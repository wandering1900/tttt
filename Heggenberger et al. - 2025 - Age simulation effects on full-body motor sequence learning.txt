Gross-motor sequence learning is fundamental for performing daily activities and maintaining independence
across the lifespan. This study investigated how age and age simulation affect gross-motor sequence learning,
focusing on acquisition, execution performance, explicit recall, and retention performance. We tested 74
participants belonging to five groups: young adults aged 18–27 years without (n = 14) or with (n = 15) an age
simulation suit, middle-aged adults aged 30–59 years without (n = 15) or with (n = 15) the suit, and older
adults aged 60–86 years without the suit (n = 15). Participants in the suit condition wore the GERonTologic
Simulator age suit (Moll, 2021), which simulates age-related physical impairments by reducing sensory
perception, flexibility, and strength. Participants performed a fixed 10-element gross-motor sequence task
requiring full-body movements over 28 practice trials. Explicit sequence recall was assessed after acquisition,
and a retention test was conducted on the following day. All groups demonstrated implicit sequence learning
and maintained their performance levels from the end of acquisition to the retention test. However, young
adults without the suit exhibited the fastest execution times and highest explicit recall scores. Notably, the suit
significantly impaired execution performance and explicit recall in both younger and middle-aged adults,
indicating that peripheral impairments can hinder explicit memory formation even when implicit learning
remains intact. These findings highlight the significant impact of peripheral sensorimotor declines on grossmotor sequence learning and memory formation across the adult lifespan. The results underscore the
importance of considering both cognitive and sensorimotor factors in motor learning research.
Public Significance Statement
This study demonstrates that peripheral constraints, simulated by an age simulation suit, can hamper
performance and explicit memory formation of whole-body motor sequence tasks. The findings
underscore the importance of sensorimotor factors for understanding motor skill preservation and
independence across the lifespan.

Motor sequence learning refers to the process of acquiring and
executing a series of movements in a specific temporal and/or spatial
order. This skill is crucial for many daily activities, such as typing on
a keyboard, as well as for tasks requiring full-body coordination,
such as dancing or getting dressed. As people age, the ability
to perform motor sequences becomes vital for maintaining
independence and quality of life. However, performing a sequence
of movements, particularly those involving the entire body, can
become more challenging with age.
Previous studies report that older adults can still learn new, simple
motor sequences (Daselaar et al., 2003; D. V. Howard & Howard,
1992; King et al., 2013; Shea et al., 2006; Vieweg et al., 2023;

Voelcker-Rehage, 2008; Wilson et al., 2012) but often execute them
at a significantly slower speed compared with younger adults (Shea
et al., 2006; Verwey, 2010). For example, a study conducted by
Shea et al. (2006) directly compared younger adults (19–33 years)
with older adults (66–78 years) on an implicit sequence learning
task. Participants operated a lever with their forearm and moved it as
quickly as possible to visually presented target locations on a
tabletop, including blocks of random and repeating sequences. Both
age groups improved their performance on the repeated sequence
blocks through practice, demonstrating that older adults are capable
of implicitly learning motor sequences. However, older adults were
consistently slower than younger adults during acquisition and
retention, and young adults improved faster over the practice trials.
This has been attributed to an inability of older adults to switch to a
sequencing mode and effectively use motor chunks (Shea et
al., 2006).
Despite studies that find preserved implicit sequence learning
with age, other research points to age-related declines in these tasks
(for an overview see King et al., 2013). Specifically, under conditions of increased task complexity or when explicit awareness of
the sequence pattern is required, older adults exhibit slower learning
rates than younger adults (I. J. Bennett et al., 2011; Feeney et al.,
2002; D. V. Howard & Howard, 2001; J. H. Howard et al., 2008;
King et al., 2013; Willingham et al., 2002). Furthermore, the explicit
awareness of learned patterns declines with age (D. V. Howard &
Howard, 1989, 1992; Verwey, 2010; Verwey et al., 2011). In a study
by Verwey et al. (2011), younger (18–28 years) and older (55–62
years) participants practiced two fixed key press sequences. While
both age groups were able to learn implicitly, older participants
demonstrated reduced explicit awareness and recall compared with
their younger counterparts. This may be linked to less efficient
development of motor chunks and to a stronger focus on associative
learning and external cues (Verwey et al., 2011).
Furthermore, with increasing age, individuals tend to have difficulties in consolidating motor sequence memories, demonstrating
fewer offline gains than younger adults (Brown et al., 2009; King
et al., 2013; Nemeth & Janacsek, 2011; Shea et al., 2006; Spencer
et al., 2007).
While most studies have examined age differences in motor
sequence learning and retention between younger (typically under
40 years old) and older adults (60+ years), relatively little research
has specifically focused on middle-aged individuals, although this
period often marks the beginning of cognitive and motor decline
(Dohm-Hansen et al., 2024).
The studies conducted so far have yielded mixed results. Gaillard
et al. (2009) found that participants across different age groups,
including young adults (22 years old), middle-aged adults (45 years
old), and older adults (71 years old), demonstrated similar performance levels in motor sequence learning when completing a
serial reaction time task, which involved reacting to visual stimuli
following an implicit repeating pattern. Conversely, Janacsek et al.
(2012) identified a noticeable decline in learning abilities starting
around the age of 45 when responding to sequences of visual stimuli
that alternated between random and repeating patterns. A study by
Meissner et al. (2016) even discovered a striking deficit in implicit
sequence learning specific to middle-aged adults (30–50 years)
compared with younger and older adults during a serial reaction time
task. The authors suggest that middle-aged adults may experience a
unique transitional period wherein implicit procedural learning
abilities decline. These findings underscore the importance of
examining changes across the full adult lifespan (Meissner
et al., 2016).
Taken together, previous research indicates that older participants
often exhibit slower execution, poorer explicit awareness, and less
effective retention performance compared with younger participants
in motor sequence learning (Shea et al., 2006; Verwey, 2010;
Verwey et al., 2011).
Reasons for Age-Related Differences in Motor
Sequence Learning
As people age, they experience declines in various sensory,
motor, and cognitive functions (Leversen et al., 2012; S.-C. Li &
Dinse, 2002; Voelcker-Rehage, 2008). These declines can be
attributed to both central and peripheral causes (Kuehn et al., 2018;
Roberts & Allen, 2016; Vieweg et al., 2023).
Peripheral impairments include changes in sensory and motor
systems, which are not directly attributable to changes in the central
nervous system. For example, aging leads to deterioration of sensory
organs, such as the eyes and ears, resulting in reduced visual acuity,
contrast sensitivity, depth perception, and hearing loss (Gilmore
et al., 2006; Glass, 2007; Huang & Tang, 2010; Jackson & Owsley,
2003; Murphy et al., 2002; Nusbaum, 1999; Rubin et al., 1994;
Schneider et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2008). Additionally, proprioceptive abilities, crucial for perceiving the position and movement
of limbs, decline due to the degeneration of peripheral nerves (Goble
et al., 2009). These sensory impairments hinder the accurate perception and response to environmental stimuli, which is essential for
successful motor task performance (François et al., 2011; Novak &
Deshpande, 2014). Furthermore, peripheral motor impairments,
including decreased muscle strength and mass, reduced joint flexibility, and increased muscle stiffness, can impair movement coordination and speed, making it difficult to execute precise and complex
movements (Hunter et al., 2016; Marcucci & Reggiani, 2020).
Central causes for age-related performance differences involve
changes within the brain (I. J. Bennett et al., 2011; Khaing et al.,
2023; Kuehn et al., 2018). The common cause hypothesis suggests
that declines in sensory, motor, and cognitive functions are interconnected, stemming from a shared underlying factor, that is, brain
aging (Anstey et al., 2001, 2003; Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997;
Ghisletta & Lindenberger, 2005; Lindenberger & Ghisletta, 2009).
This theory posits that neurobiological changes, such as reduced
brain volume and lower neurotransmitter levels, contribute to declines
as people age (Lindenberger & Ghisletta, 2009). For instance, changes
in the brain’s ability to process sensory information, like vestibular
system degeneration, can lead to balance issues (Cronin et al., 2017).
Motor impairments arise from decreased neural efficiency in the
cortico-striatal system, which is crucial for movement planning and
execution (Seidler, 2010; Toni et al., 2002).
Declines in the central nervous system are primarily associated
with cognitive impairments (Morrison & Baxter, 2012). Neuroimaging
studies have revealed significant volume reductions and decreases
in dopamine levels, especially in the frontal cortex and striatum,
which are essential for sequence learning and memory formation
(Flöel et al., 2005; Gunning-Dixon et al., 1998; Kennedy & Raz,
2005; King et al., 2013; Kuehn et al., 2018; Raz et al., 2003; Simon
et al., 2011). Additionally, the integrity of White matter tracts
connecting key brain regions declines (I. J. Bennett et al., 2011),

and older adults show decreased activation in areas like the
putamen, affecting learning and retrieval (Aizenstein et al., 2006;
King et al., 2013; Van Impe et al., 2009).
While age-related differences in motor sequence learning are
well-documented at the behavioral level, the relative contributions
of peripheral and central causes to performance deficits remain
underexplored. Understanding the specific impact of peripheral
impairments, distinct from central cognitive decline, is essential for
developing targeted interventions to mitigate age-related deficits.
Moreover, most previous studies on age differences in motor
sequence learning have compared young and older adults. However,
sensorimotor and cognitive changes typically begin to manifest in
midlife (Dohm-Hansen et al., 2024; van Wieringen et al., 2022), so
including this age group in studies in motor sequence learning is an
important addition to the literature.
Age Simulation
Researchers have increasingly used age simulation suits to mimic
age-related limitations. Age simulation suits mirror some of the
sensory and motor constraints of healthy aging, such as vision loss,
hearing deficits, reduced strength, decreased flexibility, impaired
balance, and slowed movement execution (Gerhardy et al., 2022,
2024; Moll, 2021). Age simulation suits use weights, joint bandages,
blurry glasses, noise-insulation earmuffs, gloves, and “wobbly”
overshoes (Moll, 2021; Schaefer et al., 2023; Vieweg et al.,
2023). Note that the suits only manipulate “peripheral” aspects of
aging (i.e., via reductions in sensory acuity), while they do not
influence the neural integrity of the brain. They therefore allow
researchers to experimentally disentangle the influence of peripheral
versus central nervous system changes and their respective influence
on performance.
A study conducted by Vieweg and Schaefer (2020) investigated
the effects of wearing the age simulation suit model “GERonTologic
Simulator” (GERT; Moll, 2021) on gross-motor, fine-motor, and
cognitive abilities of young adults in their early 20s. In a repeated
measures design, the suit significantly reduced performance across
all domains to levels typical of 50- to 85-year-olds.
Another study by Vieweg et al. (2023) investigated how the age
simulation suit affects implicit motor sequence learning, cognitive
speed tasks, and far visual acuity in younger individuals. The study
involved three groups: young adults with the suit (M = 23.2 years),
young adults without the suit (M = 23.6 years), and older adults
(M = 72.6 years). The motor sequence learning task involved
moving a lever with one’s dominant arm to match a displayed
spatial–temporal target pattern. Older adults made significantly
more errors when executing motor sequences and showed less
learning compared with younger adults, regardless of whether the
younger participants wore the age simulation suit or not. Although
the suit reduced the younger adults’ far visual acuity to levels similar
to older adults, it did not impact their cognitive processing speed or
ability to learn motor sequences (Vieweg et al., 2023). This suggests
that cognitive factors, such as reduced processing speed, are responsible for the poorer performance of older adults (Vieweg et al., 2023).
However, the experimental setup may have minimized the potential
impact of the age simulation suit, as participants performed the task
while seated with their arm resting on a lever. This raises the question
of how the suit would affect performance in motor sequence learning
tasks that require full-body involvement.
The Present Study
While prior work has often demonstrated preserved implicit
motor sequence learning abilities in aging, performance decrements
and impaired learning rates have also been observed compared with
younger adults (for an overview see King et al., 2013). Interestingly,
most motor sequence learning studies have utilized paradigms
involving seated, small-scale movements, raising the question of
whether similar findings emerge for gross-motor sequence learning
tasks requiring whole-body movements. While some research has
addressed gross-motor sequence learning in younger adults
(Blischke & Malangré, 2017; Genzel et al., 2012; Gudberg et al.,
2015; Kempler & Richmond, 2012; Malangré & Blischke, 2016;
Malangré et al., 2014; Morita et al., 2012), these studies did not
investigate age-related differences. To our knowledge, no prior
study has directly compared gross-motor sequence learning across
younger, middle-aged, and older adults. The present study therefore
aimed to fill this gap by examining full-body motor sequence learning
across the adult lifespan.
The observed age-related differences in prior research have
been attributed to age-related declines in sensory, motor, and
cognitive functioning (Leversen et al., 2012; S.-C. Li & Dinse,
2002; Vieweg & Schaefer, 2020; Vieweg et al., 2023; VoelckerRehage, 2008). To elucidate how sensorimotor impairments specifically contribute to changes in sequence acquisition and retention
across adulthood, we used an age simulation suit that mimics the
peripheral constraints of healthy physical aging in younger and
middle-aged participants. The gross-motor, multistep, dynamic
movement sequence task of the present study places high demands
on whole-body control, balance, and coordination, making it more
ecologically valid than previous motor sequence learning tasks.
The biomechanical and sensorimotor deficits simulated by the age
suit are likely to impact the ability to accurately execute a complex
full-body movement sequence.
Additionally, a middle-aged adult group is included, as this age
may represent a decline in implicit procedural capacities (Meissner
et al., 2016). This allows us to investigate whether young adults are
more successful than middle-aged adults in compensating for the
suit-related constraints (Freund & Baltes, 2002; Raz, 2009).
Based on studies indicating that implicit sequence learning is
generally preserved with age (D. V. Howard & Howard, 1992; Shea
et al., 2006), we hypothesize that all groups demonstrate implicit
learning, as evidenced by improvements in response times over
time. However, we predict that the execution performance is slower
in middle-aged and older adults due to age-related declines in motor
and cognitive functions (King et al., 2013; Salthouse, 1996).
In contrast to the findings by Vieweg et al. (2023), we anticipate a
significant impact of the age simulation suit on performance in the
gross-motor sequence task. We expect that the full-body movements
make the peripheral impairments simulated by the suit more challenging to compensate for, leading to a pronounced performance
decline in younger and middle-aged adults wearing the suit.
Furthermore, we evaluate age differences in the ability to transition from implicitly learned motor representations to explicit,
conscious sequence knowledge through a combination of verbal
recall and physical reproduction following initial implicit practice.
We anticipate that older adults demonstrate the poorest explicit
sequence recall (Verwey et al., 2011) and that the peripheral impairments imposed by the suit disrupt the formation of explicit
sequence representations in younger and middle-aged adults. We
predict that the increased cognitive load required to compensate for
the suit’s restrictions hinders the transition from implicit learning to
explicit memory.
Finally, we hypothesize that older adults show poorer retention
test performance for the motor sequence compared with younger
and middle-aged adults due to age-related declines in sensory,
motor, and cognitive functions, which are known to affect memory
consolidation (King et al., 2013). We also expect that the age
simulation suit negatively affects retention performance, as the
peripheral impairments challenge the consolidation of motor
memories.
Method
Power Analysis
Conducting a power analysis for linear mixed models (LMMs)
can be complex due to the models’ flexibility and the variety of
parameters involved. To estimate the required sample size for our
study, we conducted a power analysis for an interaction effect in a
mixed-design analysis of variance (between-within interaction),
which closely resembles the structure of our experimental design.
The within-subjects factor is the performance improvement from the
first to the last practice block of the implicit motor sequence learning
task, and the between-subjects factor consists of the five groups
(young without suit, young with suit, middle aged without suit,
middle aged with suit, old). Previous studies examining similar
interaction effects in motor sequence learning have reported a broad
range of effect sizes (Meissner et al., 2016; Shea et al., 2006; Vieweg
et al., 2023). Based on these findings, we conservatively assumed a
small effect size of f = .10 for our study.
Using G*Power 3.1 (Faul et al., 2007), we calculated the required
sample size with an expected small effect size of f = .10, a significance level of α = .05, and a correlation among repeated
measures of r = .85. The analysis indicated that a total sample size of
70 participants would achieve a power of approximately 81.3% to
detect the interaction effect. Our study included 74 participants,
suggesting that we have sufficient power to detect the effects of
interest.
Participants
The study included a total of 74 participants. Within the young
and middle-aged groups, participants were randomly assigned to
either the age simulation suit group or the no-suit group. Specifically,
among young adults, 15 participants wore the suit (eight men, seven
women), and 14 did not wear the suit (seven men, seven women).
Middle-aged adults were equally divided, with 15 participants in the
suit group (six men, nine women) and 15 in the no-suit group (seven
men, eight women). The older adults (n = 15, 10 men and five
women) did not wear the suit. All participants were of Caucasian
European descent and live in medium-sized towns located in western
Germany. Further demographics are presented in Table 1. The young
participants were students of Sports Science at Saarland University,
while the middle-aged and older participants were recruited from
local sports clubs and through word-of-mouth recommendation.
Exclusion criteria included the presence of neurological diseases
or severe physical impairments at the time of testing, the use of

than 60 min of sports activity per week. All participants had normal or
corrected-to-normal vision. The handedness of the participants was
determined using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, revealing
that 66 participants were right handed and eight were left handed. The
young adult participants received course credits for study participation, while the middle-aged and older participants received a
compensation of €20. All participants provided written informed
consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Faculty of Empirical Human Sciences and Economics at Saarland
University (Protocol No. 17-08). Data collection took place between
2022 and 2024 in Germany.
Materials
Age Simulation Suit
The age simulation suit used in this study is the “GERT” model
developed by Moll (2021). This suit is designed to mimic various
peripheral sensory and motor constraints frequently experienced
in the aging process. “GERT” includes special goggles that cause
blurred vision, alter color perception, and narrow visual fields,
thereby mimicking age-related vision deficits. Earmuffs are used to
simulate high-frequency hearing loss characteristics in aging. A
neck brace limits head and neck mobility, while knee and elbow
bandages restrict joint flexibility and range of motion. Additionally,
a weighted upper body vest (10 kg) and limb weights (2.3 kg
weights on each ankle and 1.5 kg on each wrist) simulate decreased
muscle strength. The suit utilizes oversized overshoes with a thick,
soft foam sole to induce instability and an unsteady walking pattern.
Special gloves reduce grip ability and fine-motor control of the
hands (see Figure 1).
10-Element Gross-Motor Task
The study involved a 10-element gross-motor sequence task. Twelve
lights from the Fitlight system (Fitlight, 2022; Silvestri et al., 2023) were
mounted on a wall (see Figure 2). The numbering of the lights was not
visible to the participants and was solely used for programming purposes. Ten lights were relevant for the implicit learning task. The
sequence of light illumination was fixed across all trials and was as
follows: 2-11-6-4-5-9-3-1-10-7. As soon as a light has been touched, the
subsequent light is illuminated, indicating the next target. Participants
were instructed to touch each light as quickly as possible.
The Fitlight system was controlled via tablet or smartphone using the
Fitlight app (Fitlight, 2021), which also recorded individual response
times in milliseconds (ms) for each sequence during the task. Lights
were deactivated upon physical contact, with the lowest sensitivity
setting, and a 0.05-s delay between the deactivation of one light and the
illumination of the next. The color of illumination for all lights was set
to blue. Each trial started from a starting line 1 m in front of the wall and
was initiated by a traffic light countdown on light Position 1. After the
traffic light counted down from red, yellow, to green, the first light was
illuminated in blue, indicating the start of the sequence. Once participants had crossed the starting line and deactivated the first light, they
continued moving directly from one target to the next without returning
to the starting line. For working on the entire sequence, participants had
to walk a total distance of about 14 m to touch the 10 elements in
each trial.

Cognitive Assessment
To evaluate cognitive abilities among participants, the following
cognitive tests were administered: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment
(Nasreddine et al., 2005), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (Wechsler,
1981), the Digit Span tasks (forward and backward; Wechsler, 1981),
and the Figural Speed Test (Schmiedek et al., 2010). Detailed descriptions of these assessments and their results are provided in
Supplemental Material S1.
Procedure
Young and middle-aged participants were randomly assigned
to either the age simulation suit group or the control group
without the suit. The group of older participants in the study
performed the experimental procedures without wearing the age
suit. This choice was made because the suit’s simulated aging
effect of approximately 30 years (Moll, 2021) would make the
older participants unreasonably advanced in age and could also
lead to physical risks (i.e., stumbling or falling) in the motor
sequence learning task.

After providing written informed consent, participants completed
questionnaires on demographics and health status. Additionally,
they were administered the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory

participation, and the Wahrgenommene Körperliche Verfassung
questionnaire (Kleinert, 2006) to assess their perceived physical
state. After completing the questionnaires, participants in the age
suit groups put on the complete “GERT” suit (Moll, 2021). All
participants underwent far visual acuity tests using the Landolt C
chart (Precision Vision, 2021).
A 5-min motor warm-up phase followed, during which participants were encouraged to move freely within the testing room (e.g.,
walking, light jogging, shoulder and arm movements) to physically
prepare for the task and, if applicable, to get used to moving with the
age simulation suit.
Subsequent to the motor warm-up period, participants were
provided with instructions to execute the gross-motor sequence task,
aiming to strike the 10-element sequence as quickly as possible.
They were free to choose which hand to use for hitting the lights and
whether they approached them by walking, running, or jumping.
As this was an implicit learning task, participants were not informed
initially that the same sequence would be assessed repeatedly.
Participants performed the gross-motor sequence task, starting each trial
behind a line 1 m in front of the wall. Upon the traffic light countdown,
the first light illuminated, allowing the participant to begin the sequence.
After striking all 10 lights, a 1-min break followed before the next trial
started. This procedure was repeated for a total of 28 trials. The trials
were grouped into seven blocks of four trials each, and after every block,
participants were allowed a 2–4-min break as needed. Upon completing
all 28 trials, participants were given a 10-min break. During this break,
they completed an additional round of the perceived physical state
questionnaire (Wahrgenommene Körperliche Verfassung questionnaire; Kleinert, 2006). The results of the Wahrgenommene Körperliche
Verfassung questionnaire are presented in Supplemental Material S2.
After the break, a recall test was administered. During the test, the
experimenter asked each participant to recall the sequence, and participants were instructed to indicate the light positions in the correct order
from 1 to 10. To do so, they were allowed to walk up to the lights and
physically point to each position while naming the light’s position
within the sequence (from 1 to 10). Note that this test came as a surprise
to participants because they had not been instructed that there was a
fixed sequence of lights in each trial or that they would have to
memorize it. This test concluded the first session. Participants returned
for a subsequent session the following day.
Day 2
On the second day of testing, anthropometric measures of height
and arm span were collected for each participant. Participants of the
“suit” groups put on the age simulation suit. To assess retention
performance after a sleep-filled consolidation phase, participants
performed eight trials (two blocks of four trials) of the same 10-element
sequence as practiced on Day 1. To assess cognitive abilities, participants subsequently completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment,
Digit Span task, Figural Speed test, and Digit Symbol test. At the end of
Session 2, young and middle-aged participants performed a transfer
test for the motor sequence task to examine potential context effects
(see Supplemental Material S3). Participants who initially learned the
sequence with the age suit now executed eight trials without the suit
and vice versa. Older adults did not perform the transfer test because
they did not wear an age simulation suit in the present study.
Statistical Analysis
To investigate the effect of age group, the age simulation suit, and
time on motor sequence learning performance during the acquisition
phase, an LMM was computed. The dependent variable was the

response time in ms for each trial, recorded from the moment the
first light was struck until the tenth and final light was struck. For
analysis, these response times were averaged across each block (four
trials in each block). The fixed effects included group (with five
levels: young without suit, young with suit, middle aged without
suit, middle aged with suit, old), time (a continuous variable representing the seven blocks), and their interaction (Group × Time).
A random intercept for participants was included to account for
interindividual variability, with trial blocks modeled as repeated
measures. To further investigate the differences between the experimental groups, contrasts were calculated by systematically adjusting
the reference group. This allowed for direct comparisons between
each group, enabling a detailed examination of differences between
groups.
To investigate group differences in the ability to transition from
implicitly learned motor representations to explicit, conscious
sequence knowledge after the acquisition phase, a Kruskal–Wallis
test was conducted. The test was used due to nonnormality in the
recall data, assessing differences in explicit sequence recall across
the five groups. The dependent variable was the explicit sequence
recall score, measured both through verbal recall and physical
reproduction following the implicit acquisition phase. Post hoc
pairwise comparisons were conducted using Dunn’s test with
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons to further explore
significant group differences. In our study, the recall score was assessed by scoring each participant’s ability to accurately reproduce
the sequence of lights in both correct positions and correct order. The
scoring system was designed to account for both perfect matches and
partial sequence accuracy. The scoring rules were as follows: Points
were awarded for recalling sequences of lights in the correct order. If a
sequence was recalled in the correct order and at the correct position,
points equal to the length of the correct sequence were awarded. If a
sequence was recalled in the correct order but started at the wrong
position, the points were reduced by 1. Participants also earned points
for recalling individual lights in the correct position. For example, if
the correct sequence was 2, 11, 6, 4, 5, 9, 3, 1, 10, 7, and the
participant recalled 3, 11, 6, 1, 5, 10, 7, 2, 4, 9, the chunk 11, 6 was
correctly recalled at Positions 2 and 3, earning 2 points. The chunk 10,
7 was correctly recalled but started at the wrong position (Positions 6
and 7 instead of 9 and 10), earning 2 − 1 = 1 point. The number 5 was
correctly recalled at the fifth position, earning 1 point. The total recall
score for this sequence would therefore be 4.
To analyze retention performance, another LMM was conducted.
The dependent variable was the response time, and the fixed effects
included group (with five levels), time (with two levels: last block of
acquisition and first block of retention), and their interaction. The
model also included a random intercept for participants, accounting
for interindividual variability, with repeated measures across time.
As with the first model, pairwise comparisons for the retention
performance analysis were conducted using contrasts. The reference
group was systematically adjusted to allow for specific pairwise
comparisons between the groups and across time points. Significance
levels were set at α = .05 for all analyses.
Transparency and Openness
Our study complies with the Journal Article Reporting Standards
guidelines (Appelbaum et al., 2018), detailing sample size determination, manipulations, and all measured variables. None of the
data met our predetermined exclusion criteria (described below), so
all analyses were conducted using the full data set. The study was
preregistered. However, it should be noted that the study was initially preregistered with three groups: young without suit, young
with suit, and older adults. The middle-aged groups (with and
without the suit) were later added to provide more comprehensive
insights into age-related differences across the lifespan. The preregistration, deidentified data, materials, and analytic scripts are
publicly available on the Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/
zxb46/. The statistical analyses were conducted using R Statistical
Software (Version 4.4.0) for Windows (R Core Team, 2023). The
main analyses were conducted using the R package lme4 (Bates et
al., 2015, Version 1.1.35.2).
Results
The main analyses included the full sample with all five
experimental groups. Note that a supplementary analysis examining baseline age-related differences, including only the three
groups without the suit, is provided in Supplemental Material S4.
This analysis showed that all groups demonstrated implicit
learning, as indicated by performance improvements over time.
However, young adults performed faster than both middle-aged
and older adults, who did not differ significantly from each other.
This suggests that age-related differences in execution performance already emerge in middle adulthood. For full statistical
details, see Supplemental Material S4.
Performance During Acquisition and Motor Sequence
Learning
The analyses were based on the seven acquisition blocks shown in
Figure 3. The LMM showed strong explanatory power, with a
marginal R2 = .57 (fixed effects only) and a conditional R2 = .92
(fixed and random effects combined), indicating that a large proportion of variance in the data was accounted for. The model revealed a significant main effect of time (b = −222.36, 95% CI
[−279.52, −165.21], SE = 29.16), t(442.00) = −7.63, p < .001,
indicating that response times decreased significantly over the
course of the blocks across all groups. In addition, there was a
significant main effect of group on response times, indicating that
motor sequence performance varied significantly across the different
groups (b = 14512.38, 95% CI [11720.88, 17303.87], SE =
1430.10), t(294.11) = 10.15, p < .001.
Differences Between Age Groups Without the Suit
Contrasts revealed that younger adults without the suit demonstrated significantly faster response times compared with both middleaged adults without the suit (b = 34130.24, 95% CI [21256.97,
47003.50], SE = 6669.63), t(442.00) = 5.12, p < .001, and older
adults (b = 45648.71, 95% CI [32775.44, 58521.98], SE = 6669.63),
t(442.00) = 6.84, p < .001. Younger adults without the suit had the
fastest response times, reflecting superior motor sequence performance. Middle-aged adults without the suit did not perform significantly different from older adults.

Effects of the Age Simulation Suit
The age simulation suit significantly impaired performance in both
younger and middle-aged adults. Younger adults wearing the suit still
performed significantly better than older adults (b = 34567.96, 95%
CI [21918.59, 47217.33], SE = 6553.62), t(442.00) = 5.28, p < .001,
as well as middle-aged adults both without the suit (b = 23049.48,
95% CI [10400.11, 35698.85], SE = 6553.62), t(442.00) = 3.52, p <
.001, and with the suit (b = 47759.24, 95% CI [35109.87, 60408.61],
SE = 6553.62), t(442.00) = 7.29, p < .001. However, their response
times were notably slower than those of younger adults without the
suit (b = −11081.75, 95% CI [−23954.02, 1792.52], SE = 3386.87),
t(442.00) = −3.27, p < .001, indicating that the suit had a significant
impact on their performance.
Middle-aged adults wearing the suit exhibited significantly slower
response times compared with middle-aged adults without the suit
(b = 24709.76, 95% CI [12060.39, 37359.13], SE = 6553.62),
t(442.00) = 3.77, p < .001. Furthermore, their performance was
slower than that of older adults (b = 13191.28, 95% CI [541.91,
25840.65], SE = 6553.62), t(442.00) = 2.01, p = .045.
Group × Time Interaction
The interaction between group and time was also significant (b =
−42.70, 95% CI [−58.83, −26.57], SE = 8.23), t(442.00) = −5.19,
p < .001. Contrasts indicated that this effect was primarily driven by
two results: Older adults showed a significantly greater improvement in response times over the course of the blocks compared with
younger adults, both without the suit (b = −126.06, SE = 38.26),
t(439.00) = −3.30, p = .001, and with the suit (b = −84.15, SE =
37.60), t(439.00) = −2.24, p = .026. Additionally, middle-aged
adults wearing the age simulation suit demonstrated a significantly
stronger improvement in response times compared with middle-aged
adults without the suit (b = 153.05, SE = 37.60), t(439.00) = 4.07, p <
.001, and compared with younger adults, both with and without the
suit. The detailed statistical results for the contrasts of the interaction
effects are presented in Table 2.
Recall Performance After Acquisition
The distribution of explicit sequence recall scores for each
experimental group is displayed in Figure 4 using box plots. A
Kruskal–Wallis test revealed significant differences in explicit
sequence recall after the acquisition phase across the groups,
χ2(4, N = 74) = 351.73, p < .001, η2 = 0.17. Post hoc pairwise
comparisons using Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction revealed significant group differences for all comparisons, except
between younger adults with the suit and middle-aged adults
without the suit (see Table 3).
Retention Performance
The right-hand side of Figure 3 displays the mean averaged
response times for the first retention block for each group. To
analyze retention performance, another LMM was conducted,
with time specifically referring to the comparison between the last
block of acquisition and the first block of retention. The model
showed strong explanatory power with R2 = .51 (marginal) and
R2 = .95 (conditional).
The analysis revealed a significant main effect of group on
response times (b = 7705.19, 95% CI [5876.19, 9534.20], SE =
935.02), t(80.18) = 8.24, p < .001, indicating significant differences
in response times between the experimental groups. Contrasts revealed the same general response time differences that were already
observed during the acquisition phase.

The main effect of time was not significant, suggesting no significant overall change in response times between the last block of
acquisition and the first block of retention. The interaction between
group and time was also not significant, indicating that implicit
knowledge of the sequence, as evidenced by response times, was
retained to a similar extent across all groups.
Discussion
This study examined the effects of age and an age simulation
suit on gross-motor sequence learning, focusing on a full-body
movement task. While previous research indicates that implicit motor
sequence learning is generally preserved with age, older adults typically show slower execution and poorer retention performance (King
et al., 2013). However, these findings have mostly been based on
small-scale, seated tasks. To increase ecological validity, we employed
a 10-element gross-motor sequence task emphasizing whole-body
control, balance, and coordination. We also included a middle-aged
group, as procedural learning may begin to decline during this stage of
life (Meissner et al., 2016). We also employed an age simulation suit,
which allowed us to simulate peripheral impairments typically associated with aging.

All groups exhibited implicit learning, as evidenced by faster
response times over time, with younger adults outperforming middleaged and older adults in execution performance. However, the age
simulation suit significantly impaired execution performance. Middleaged adults wearing the suit demonstrated the slowest response times,
performing worse than their peers without the suit and older adults.
Despite these performance differences, retention of the learned motor
sequence was comparable across all groups, with participants not
showing any significant performance decrements from the last
acquisition block on Day 1 to the first retention block on Day 2.
Additionally, the age simulation suit diminished explicit recall
performance in both younger and middle-aged adults, indicating
that peripheral impairments can hinder the transition from implicit
learning to explicit recall.
Acquisition
The superior performance of younger adults without the age
simulation suit aligns with extensive literature indicating that
younger adults typically outperform older adults in motor sequence
tasks (Shea et al., 2006; Verwey, 2010). This advantage is likely due to
preserved cognitive and motor functions in younger adults, including
faster processing speed, greater working memory capacity, and more
efficient motor control systems (King et al., 2013; Salthouse, 1996).
Their superior sensory and motor abilities (Hunter et al., 2016; S.-C. Li
& Dinse, 2002), combined with stronger cognitive functions, as reflected in higher scores on cognitive background measures (see
Supplemental Material S1), contributed to their superior performance.
Young adults with the suit performed worse than young adults
without the suit. This suggests that peripheral sensorimotor impairments can adversely affect gross-motor sequence execution.
However, their performance remained superior to that of middleaged and older adults, which may indicate that younger adults were
able to partially compensate for the suit-induced constraints due to
their intact cognitive-motor capacities. Alternatively, or additionally, this result may reflect limitations in the degree to which the age
simulation suit accurately mimics age-related sensorimotor decline
in younger individuals.
The significant performance difference between young adults
with and without the suit contrasts with previous research by
Note. Results of Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction (z value, p value)
and the effect size (r). Bold values indicate statistically significant results
(p < .05).
Vieweg et al. (2023). This might be due to the complexity of the
gross-motor sequence task, aligning with the sensorimotor integration theory, which posits that tasks requiring integration of
multiple sensory inputs and motor outputs are particularly susceptible to disruptions from peripheral impairments (K. Z. H. Li &
Lindenberger, 2002).
Middle-aged participants without the suit and older adults did not
differ in gross-motor sequence learning, showing similar learning
curves and overall performance in response times. Our finding is
consistent with Gaillard et al. (2009), who also observed no significant differences in sequence learning abilities between these age
groups. However, we had expected that the middle-aged participants
would exhibit faster overall response times in the gross-motor task
during execution due to their generally better motor and sensory
abilities. The lack of difference in response times could be explained
by several factors. Older adults may develop compensatory strategies that help maintain motor performance, resulting in response
times comparable to those of middle-aged adults (Gaillard et al.,
2009). Additionally, the older participants in our study were more
physically active compared with the middle-aged groups, which
may have contributed to their preserved motor function (VoelckerRehage & Niemann, 2013).
Middle-aged adults wearing the age simulation suit had the
slowest response times, performing slower than both middle-aged
adults without the suit and older adults. This suggests that the
combination of age-related motor declines beginning in midlife and
the peripheral impairments simulated by the suit collectively contributed to the observed performance deficits. The findings underscore
the particular vulnerability of middle-aged adults to additional sensorimotor challenges. This finding supports the resource theory of
cognitive aging, which posits that available cognitive resources
diminish with age, reducing compensatory capabilities (Salthouse,
1996). Alternatively, the particularly poor performance of middle-aged
adults wearing the suit may reflect an oversimulation effect, where the
combination of early age-related decline and additional peripheral
constraints exceeds typical aging-related impairments.
Despite differences in overall performance, all groups demonstrated implicit motor sequence learning, as evidenced by improvements over time, indicating that implicit learning processes are
relatively preserved across the lifespan (D. V. Howard & Howard,
1992; Shea et al., 2006). The ability to learn and improve on the
gross-motor sequence task, regardless of age or the presence of
peripheral impairments, underscores the robustness of procedural
memory systems, which are less susceptible to age-related decline
and sensorimotor constraints (King et al., 2013). Although all groups
showed implicit learning and improvement over time, the interaction
effect revealed that middle-aged adults wearing the suit demonstrated
a steeper improvement in their learning curve over time compared
with middle-aged adults without the suit and the two younger groups.
However, this effect is likely attributable to their slower baseline
response times, which allowed more room for improvement. In
addition, the steeper improvement may reflect a gradual acclimatization to the suit. Although all participants completed a 5-min warmup period before the task, this may not have been sufficient for full
adaptation, particularly for middle-aged adults, who might require
more time to adjust to the physical constraints. Therefore, part of the
observed learning effect may reflect growing familiarity with the suit
rather than pure motor sequence learning. This interpretation aligns
with previous findings suggesting that perceptual-motor recalibration

remains relatively intact in older adults, particularly under
challenging or novel conditions, but may require more time to
unfold (Brand & de Oliveira, 2023; Vandevoorde & Orban de
Xivry, 2019).
Older adults also exhibited steeper learning curves compared with
both young groups, but this was most likely due to less room for
further improvement in the young groups.
Recall Performance
The present study also investigated the effects of age and age
simulation on explicit sequence recall following implicit grossmotor sequence learning. Participants were not informed that they
would later be asked to recall the sequence, precluding intentional
encoding strategies. Younger adults without the age simulation suit
exhibited the highest recall performance, significantly outperforming
middle-aged adults without the suit and older adults. Middle-aged
adults without the suit showed intermediate recall ability, while
older adults had the lowest recall scores. Notably, the age simulation suit significantly reduced recall performance in both
younger and middle-aged adults. Younger adults wearing the suit
performed even at a level comparable to middle-aged adults
without the suit, indicating that the suit effectively mimicked agerelated declines in explicit recall ability.
These findings align with previous research indicating that aging
negatively impacts the ability to transition from implicitly learned
motor sequences to explicit, conscious recall, even when explicit
encoding is not prompted (Verwey et al., 2011). The reduced
explicit recall in older participants may be attributed to their less
efficient encoding and retrieval of higher order sequence information, which is critical for sequence learning, and their stronger
reliance on associative learning and external cues (Verwey et al.,
2011). The present study extends these observations by demonstrating that simulated peripheral sensorimotor deficits can impair
explicit recall in younger and middle-aged adults, despite implicit
learning processes remaining intact. The age simulation suit primarily imposes peripheral sensory and motor constraints, not
affecting central cognitive processes (Moll, 2021; Vieweg &
Schaefer, 2020). The induced peripheral deficits appear to interfere
with the incidental formation of explicit sequence representations.
It is possible that the additional effort required to compensate for
the suit-related constraints consumes cognitive resources that would
otherwise be available for incidental memory encoding (Wickens,
2008). The increased cognitive load may hinder the incidental
consolidation of explicit knowledge. This is consistent with theories
suggesting that tasks requiring substantial attentional resources are
more susceptible to declines due to increased cognitive load or aging
(Craik & Byrd, 1982; Shanks & St. John, 1994).
Because participants were not aware that they would need to
recall the sequence later, any explicit memory formation relied on
incidental learning processes that can be sensitive to the distribution
of attentional resources during task performance (Frensch & Miner,
1994; Stadler, 1995). Increased motor task complexity and motor
demands can interfere with the ability to extract and encode higher
order sequence information (Bo et al., 2009). In the present study,
the full-body sequence task required participants to engage their
entire body, combining gross-motor coordination with spatial
navigation and balance. The suit may have elevated the physical
difficulty of the task to a level wherein participants’ attentional
focus shifted predominantly to immediate motor execution rather
than to the underlying sequence pattern.
Middle-aged adults without the suit already demonstrated reduced
incidental explicit recall compared with younger adults, which may
reflect the beginning of subtle declines in sensorimotor processing
efficiency (K. Z. H. Li & Lindenberger, 2002). When wearing the
suit, middle-aged adults’ performance declined further, approaching
that of older adults. This may suggest that the combination of agerelated sensorimotor integration challenges and peripheral impairments imposed by the suit exacerbated difficulties in forming explicit
sequence representations. This interpretation does not preclude an
attentional resource explanation. On the contrary, it is likely that the
additional effort required to manage the physical constraints of the
suit diverted attentional resources away from incidental encoding
processes. Thus, both sensorimotor limitations and increased cognitive load may have jointly contributed to the impaired explicit
recall observed in the groups wearing the suit.
Retention Performance
We initially hypothesized that retention performance would be
poorer in the older group due to age-related declines in sensory,
motor, and cognitive functions. However, our findings revealed
that all groups, regardless of age or the use of the age simulation
suit, maintained similar response time performance on the day
following acquisition.
Our findings stand in contrast to previous research, such as the
studies conducted by Shea et al. (2006) and King et al. (2013), which
have documented a decline in motor sequence retention performance among older adults compared with their younger counterparts. One possible explanation for this finding is that, in grossmotor sequence learning, once a sequence is learned implicitly, the
retention of this motor memory might be more robust against agerelated declines and peripheral impairments. Gross-motor tasks
often involve larger, more ingrained movement patterns that rely
heavily on procedural memory, which is known to be more resistant
to decay compared with other types of memory (Doyon & Benali,
2005). The physical nature of these tasks may engage deep motor
circuits in the brain that are less susceptible to the effects of aging
and peripheral constraints, such as those simulated by the suit
(Robertson, 2007).
Furthermore, the consolidation of motor sequences in grossmotor tasks may benefit from the repetitive, whole-body engagement that characterizes these types of activities. This could lead to a
stronger, more durable motor memory that is less affected by agerelated changes or the temporary impairments imposed by the age
simulation suit. As a result, the retention of gross-motor sequences
might be more consistent across different age groups, reflecting
the resilience of procedural learning and memory in these types
of tasks.
Notably, as no explicit recall test was administered on Day 2, the
retention assessment was based solely on task performance and
thus primarily reflects implicit memory processes. While preserved
response times suggest stable implicit retention of the learned
sequence across groups, no conclusions can be drawn regarding
the retention of explicit sequence knowledge over time.

Limitations and Future Directions
This study has limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. The age simulation suit used in this study was
intended to model peripheral physical constraints associated with
aging, such as reduced joint mobility, muscle strength, and sensory
acuity, without altering central cognitive functions. However, the
simulation may not affect all individuals equally (Moll, 2021). The
suit does not simulate the full complexity of biological aging,
including neurocognitive decline, fatigue, or motivational changes.
Therefore, the suit is not a comprehensive model of aging but rather
a tool to isolate the impact of peripheral impairments on age-related
performance differences.
In addition, the age range within the middle-aged group was quite
broad, spanning from 30 to 59 years. This wide age range may have
introduced variability in the cognitive and motor decline experienced by participants, potentially masking more specific age-related
trends within this group. Another limitation of this study are differences between groups in the level of physical activity. The older
adults engaged in more minutes of physical activity per week
compared with the middle-aged adults, which may have contributed
to their preserved motor function and potentially biased the results.
This should be taken into account when interpreting the findings
because representative samples of older adults typically engage in
less physical activity than the subjects tested in the present study
(Moschny et al., 2011).
In future studies, exploring the role of physical activity across
different age groups may reveal whether regular exercise mitigates
age-related declines in gross-motor sequence learning. Utilizing
neuroimaging techniques like electroencephalography could
uncover the neural mechanisms underlying gross-motor sequence
learning and how they are affected by aging and peripheral impairments. Additionally, varying the complexity of motor tasks
might help determine optimal training strategies for enhancing
motor learning in different age groups. Assessing explicit sequence
recall also after the retention test on Day 2 would show whether age
differences in explicit recall remain stable or decrease over time and
with additional practice. Finally, investigating the contributions of
various sensory modalities to gross-motor sequence learning could
lead to targeted interventions that improve performance by addressing
specific sensory system impairments.
Conclusion
Our study revealed that implicit gross-motor sequence learning is
preserved across different age groups, but execution performance
and explicit recall are significantly influenced by age and peripheral
impairments simulated by an age simulation suit. Younger adults
demonstrated superior execution performance, and while the age
simulation suit impaired their performance, they still outperformed
middle-aged and older adults. Middle-aged adults wearing the suit
showed the lowest performance level, performing worse than both
their unsuited peers and older adults, highlighting their vulnerability
to additional sensorimotor challenges.
Despite variations in execution and recall performance, all groups
retained the learned motor sequences similarly, suggesting that the
retention of gross-motor skills is robust against age-related declines
and peripheral impairments. The suit’s impact on explicit recall
indicates that peripheral constraints can increase cognitive load,
hindering the incidental formation of explicit memory even when
implicit learning remains unaffected.
These findings underscore the complex interplay between age,
peripheral impairments, and motor learning. They highlight the need
to consider both cognitive and sensorimotor factors when developing strategies to support motor function and learning across the
lifespan.
