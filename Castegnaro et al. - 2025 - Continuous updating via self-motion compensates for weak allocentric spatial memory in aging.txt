Navigational skills are essential for interacting with our environment, supported by multiple types of spatial
representations. We investigated age-related differences in spatial memory using a virtual reality task that
manipulated viewpoints between the encoding and retrieval of one or four-object locations. The task
investigates compensatory mechanisms in aging, specifically how spatial updating via self-motion affects
spatial memory. We tested 21 young adults (ages 19–36) and 23 older adults (ages 63–80). The task involved
three movement conditions: same-viewpoint condition, where participants walked away and returned to the
same viewpoint; shifted-viewpoint (walking) condition where participants walked to a different viewpoint,
enabling continuous updates of their egocentric representations through self-motion; and shifted-viewpoint
(teleport) condition where participants teleported to the other viewpoint, involving both a virtual translation
and rotation of the participant’s view. Retrieval was tested by asking participants to place each object at its
previously seen location. Average displacement error was affected by age group, object configuration, and
movement condition, with an interaction between age and movement condition. Differences in movement
conditions were primarily driven by older participants, who were most accurate from the same viewpoint. In
shifted-viewpoint conditions, teleportation—where self-motion cues were absent—led to significantly greater
errors than walking in the older group. Our results highlight the role of spatial updating in supporting spatial
memory and suggest that age-related decline in allocentric representations can be mitigated by continuous
updating of egocentric representations by self-motion. We speculate that the use of spatial updating might be
impaired early in the progression to Alzheimer’s dementia due to entorhinal cortical pathology.

SELF-MOTION SUPPORTS SPATIAL MEMORY IN AGING
891
Navigational skills are essential for interacting with our environment, supported by the ability to form spatial representations. Humans
and other mammals utilize two types of spatial representations:
egocentric, which locates objects in a framework based on the observer’s location, and allocentric which involves interrelationship
among environmental elements independent of the observer’s location (Banta Lavenex et al., 2011; Burgess, 2006; for a review see
Colombo et al., 2017). These representations are largely relying on
different neural substrates, with egocentric strategies mainly associated with the parietal lobe and subcortical structures such as the
striatum (Whitlock et al., 2008), while allocentric strategies are
primarily associated with the medial temporal lobe, including the
hippocampus (Burgess et al., 2002; Ekstrom et al., 2014), entorhinal
cortex (Alex, ander et al., 2023; McNaughton et al., 2006), and
retrosplenial cortex, which plays a key role in transforming allocentric
spatial information into egocentric representations (van Wijngaarden
et al., 2020).
Egocentric representation is continuously refined by spatial
updating—the online integration of self-motion signals from
vestibular, proprioceptive, motor-efference copy, and optic flow—
to keep track of how the positions of environmental constituents
such as objects and landmarks change as we move (Klatzky et al.,
1998; R. F. Wang, 2016). Allocentric representation is preserved
by anchoring relational codes to stable environmental landmarks
and boundary geometry, thereby maintaining the metric distances
and orientations among cues over time that are independent from
the observer’s location (Byrne & Crawford, 2010). Spatial updating can operate in both egocentric and allocentric representations. In egocentric representations, each new displacement is
simply subtracted from the current egocentric vectors. In an allocentric representation, however, the same self-motion vector
must first be converted into world-centered coordinates before it
can be used to update the observers’ position within a stable
external map, making the process inherently more complex than in
the egocentric case (Frances Wang, 2017; Rolls, 2020). The selfmotion signals that maintain egocentric accuracy therefore also
contribute to the incremental construction and recalibration of
allocentric maps, supported by the hippocampal–entorhinal neural
substrate (McNaughton et al., 2006). Conversely, allocentric configurations can also be derived in the absence of physical movement
when rich visual or contextual information specifies the spatial relations among environmental constituents (Ekstrom et al., 2014).
In this framework spatial updating and allocentric processing are
complementary: updating keeps egocentric codes synchronized with
the external world in real time, while established allocentric maps
provide a stable scaffold that can reset the updating process after
disorientation (Burgess, 2006; Frances Wang, 2017).
Age-related deficits in spatial processing typically manifest first in
allocentric strategies, usually tested by encoding constituents of an
environment from one viewpoint and retrieving them from another
(Bohbot et al., 2012; Lithfous et al., 2014), with egocentric deficits
appearing later (Gazova et al., 2013; Lopez et al., 2019). These deficits
have been consistently associated with hippocampal atrophy (Driscoll
et al., 2003; Raz et al., 2005) and hippocampal reduced activation
(Moffat et al., 2006) occurring with natural aging. Lesion studies
further support the role of the hippocampus in viewpoint-shifted
spatial memory, showing severe impairments in spatial recall from
novel viewpoints in patients with hippocampal damage (Hartley et al.,
2007; King et al., 2002). However, recent evidence indicates that
spatial memory impairments associated with hippocampal damage
and aging may reflect an overall reduced precision in spatial memory
rather than an absolute loss of allocentric representations. Patients
with hippocampal lesions retain partial allocentric memory abilities in
tasks analogous to the Morris water maze but exhibit less precise and
more variable spatial responses, characterized by longer and more
circuitous paths to the remembered target locations (Kolarik et al.,
2018; McAvan et al., 2022). Similarly, older adults demonstrate
reduced spatial precision but maintain effective use of allocentric
strategies, as indicated by their continued reliance on stable distal
landmarks (McAvan et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the field still lacks a
clear consensus on what aspects of egocentric and allocentric memory
are specifically affected in aging. Possible explanations for these
differing findings involve compensatory mechanisms. For instance,
proprioceptive and vestibular cues available in immersive virtual
reality may help mitigate age-related declines in allocentric memory
(Hill et al., 2024). Additionally, older adults may compensate by
relying on geometric cues (Bécu et al., 2019; Bian & Andersen, 2013;
Rodgers et al., 2012), potentially mediated by the entorhinal cortex’s
role in continuously updating spatial representations using self-motion
information (Bohbot et al., 2007; Iaria et al., 2009; Leo´n et al., 2016).
This compensatory capacity suggests a resilience in egocentric processing that may offset allocentric decline.
Given the lack of consensus on age-related differences in spatial
representations and the proposed role of compensatory mechanisms,
the present study aims to directly investigate these issues. Specifically,
we examine how spatial updating via self-motion influences spatial
memory performance in younger and older adults. To this end, we
developed an immersive virtual reality task, Queen Square Virtual
Reality (VR; Figure 1), designed to manipulate participants’ viewpoints between the encoding and retrieval of object locations within
an environment (King et al., 2002). A same-viewpoint condition
assesses spatial memory after having participants walk away from and
return to the original encoding viewpoint, providing a baseline against
which the effects of viewpoint shifts can be compared. In a shiftedviewpoint condition, participants walk between viewpoints, enabling
them to perform spatial updating continuously through self-motion
signals. Finally, we introduced a second shifted-viewpoint condition
in which participants actively perform a “teleportation” via a button
press, setting both their virtual position and orientation to the new
viewpoint, removing self-motion inputs from vestibular, optic flow,
and proprioceptive systems that normally drive spatial updating
(Etienne & Jeffery, 2004).
In the same-viewpoint condition, we expected minimal age-related
performance differences as participants may rely on egocentric representations of object locations such as visual or motoric (e.g.,
pointing or gaze) directions, which remain relatively intact in normal
aging. Conversely, we expected age-related performance differences
between the two shifted-viewpoint conditions. Specifically, in the
shifted-viewpoint (walking) condition, participants could continuously update egocentric representations using self-motion cues,
potentially supporting spatial accuracy despite viewpoint shifts. In
contrast, the shifted-viewpoint (teleport) condition removes this
continuous spatial updating, compelling participants to rely exclusively on allocentric representations. Thus, we hypothesized greater
age-related impairments specifically in the teleport condition compared to the walking condition, reflecting the vulnerability of allocentric spatial representations to aging. Allocentric representations,
of how objects are located relative to environmental cues, could

The Queen Square Virtual Reality Task
Note. (A) Training phase environment. (B) Testing phase environment. The testing environment features a rectangular room with
a rounded corner. Participants were positioned on an L-shaped platform, elevated 1.8 m above the floor, with a red rope barrier to
mitigate vertigo. Two viewpoints on the platform, highlighted by blue lighting, were aligned with directional arrows to indicate the
participants’ forward-facing orientation. (C) Schematic of the testing procedure. Trials began with participants at one of two
viewpoints, counterbalanced across participants. During the encoding phase, either one or four objects were presented for 7 or 30 s
in total. After encoding, the objects disappeared, and participants received instructions for one of three conditions: (a) Sameviewpoint—walking away from and back to the same viewpoint, which allows for the use of both egocentric (self-referenced) and
allocentric (world-referenced) spatial representations; (b) shifted-viewpoint (walking)—walking to the other viewpoint, which
encourages reliance on allocentric representations, as participants experience a change in perspective but still benefit from
continuous self-motion updating of egocentric representations; (c) shifted-viewpoint (teleport)—teleporting to the other viewpoint
using the controller, involving an automatic translation and rotation. This condition prevents continuous updating of egocentric
representations by self-motion information, compelling participants to rely more heavily on allocentric representations to recall
object locations. In the retrieval phase, participants used a virtual pointer to recall the locations of the objects, one at a time. Icons for
the objects in part (C) are free resources from https://Flaticon.com. See the online article for the color version of this figure.
support retrieval of object locations in all three conditions. Importantly,
allocentric representations are available irrespective of viewpoint shifts
or whether self-motion information is present between encoding and
retrieval. Consequently, because any performance difference observed
between the same-viewpoint and shifted-viewpoint (walking) conditions could be attributed either to impaired spatial updating via selfmotion or to weakened allocentric representations, no specific
hypothesis was formulated regarding their comparison.
We incorporated two object configurations: one object and four
objects. The one-object configuration simplifies the task, allowing us
to assess basic comprehension and ability to perform spatial retrieval in
various conditions without significant memory load. Conversely, the
four-object configuration increases the memory load and, across the
three conditions, reveals which types of representation are available to
support this increased load. It is also worth noting that shifting
viewpoint testing of multiple object locations affords the use of an
allocentric representation of the objects compared to mental rotation
of a single object around the viewpoint (King et al., 2002). We
hypothesized that aging would impact performance in the multi-object
shifted-viewpoint conditions, consistent with previous reports of more
general age-related declines in working memory capacity (Castillo
Escamilla et al., 2023).
Method
Participants
A priori power analysis was conducted using G*Power to determine the required sample size for the analysis of variance (ANOVA)
mixed design with three within factors and one between factors.
Based on prior research, an estimated effect size (Cohen’s f ) of 0.31
was used (Rodgers et al., 2012). The analysis assumed an α level of
.05, power of 0.90, and a correlation of 0.25 among repeated measures. The results indicated a total sample size of 44 participants, with
22 per age group, to detect significant effects. Young participants (n =
21; 52% female) between ages 19–36 (M = 23.5, SD = 4.2) were
recruited from the University College London Sona participant pool.
Older adult participants (n = 23; 52% female) between ages 63–80
(M = 72.3, SD = 5.20) were recruited through the “Join Dementia
Research” online database. Exclusion criteria were the presence of
any major medical or psychiatric disorder, elevated anxiety or

screening tools (Staples et al., 2019), epilepsy, a history of alcohol
excess or any mobility or visual impairment which may compromise
performance in immersive virtual reality testing.
Ethical approval for the study titled “Investigating Spatial Memory
Functions Using Immersive Virtual Reality (iVR)” was granted by the
University College London Research Ethics Committee (ID No.
SHaPS-2018-JK-027). Ethics were in line with the regulations outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Queen Square Virtual Reality Task
The Queen Square VR task was administered using the HTC Vive
PRO VR system, equipped with a wireless adapter to avoid cablerelated issues, tracking an area of 10.0 × 5.0 m2 for free movement.
The VR environments were developed in Unity3D (Unity Software,
Inc.) and Autodesk Maya (Autodesk Inc.). The entire task took
approximately 50 min to complete.
Training Phase
Participants were trained in a separate virtual environment
(Figure 1A) to understand the task mechanics. They practiced
memorizing an object’s location for 7 s before it disappeared, then
replaced it using the controller’s trigger button as a “laser pointer,”
repeated three times with feedback (these objects were not used in
testing). Next, they practiced teleporting to “active” viewpoints
using the controller’s thumbpad, with a quick fade to black screen
transition (<∼0.1 s) to mitigate motion sickness. Finally, they
walked to different viewpoints following illuminated floor arrows,
mirroring movement conditions in the tests. Participants could
repeat any training steps before proceeding to the test phase (no
training data were recorded).
Testing Phase
The testing environment featured a rectangular room (15 m × 12 m)
with a rounded corner and an elevated L-shaped platform (1.8 m
above the floor and opposite to the rounded corner, Figure 1B), where
participants stood throughout the task. Note that participants were
able to walk freely on the platform. Two viewpoints were marked on
the platform to guide participant movements and orientation, allowing
for walking distances of 6.0 m and 4.5 m along the L-shaped platform.
The maximum possible shifted-viewpoint rotation was 125°. The
setup ensured that participants were able to actively navigate the space
along the platform, engaging in natural self-motion during walking
conditions.
At the start, each participant was assigned one of two viewpoints as
the “same-viewpoint” in a counterbalanced design across participants.
Consequently, the direction of the shifted-viewpoint transitions
(i.e., from the same to the shifted viewpoint) remained consistent
for each participant across all trials, and this directionality was
counterbalanced between participants. Participants always began
each trial from this same-viewpoint location. Each trial consisted
of three steps (Figure 1C): (a) encoding, (b) movement manipulation, and (c) retrieval, where participants were asked to replace
the objects in their original locations. Trials included either one or
four objects.
Participants completed a total of 30 trials for each combination of
movement condition and object configuration, divided into three
blocks with optional 2-min rest periods between blocks.
The primary outcome measure was displacement error—the
absolute distance in meters between the chosen and the actual object
locations. The secondary outcome measure was retrieval time—the
duration taken to place an object after receiving it via the virtual
pointer.
Encoding
Participants were instructed via in-VR messages to memorize the
locations of either one or four objects placed at pseudo-randomized
coordinates on the floor. They had 10 s for single-object trials and 30
s for four-object trials, with a timer displayed in the VR interface.
After the allotted time, the objects and timer disappeared. Objects
were placed at least 0.5 m apart to avoid overlap and occlusion.
Objects were selected from a pool of 108 unique low-poly 3D
models of everyday items (e.g., fruits, furniture, animals, plants,
utensils), each scaled to fit within 0.8 m3. No objects were repeated
across trials.
Movement Condition
Each trial included a movement manipulation (Figure 1C;
Supplemental Video, Castegnaro et al., 2025): (a) “same-viewpoint”
where participants walked along the platform’s side and returned to the
starting viewpoint to control for the total amount of movement
between encoding and retrieval; (b) “shifted-viewpoint (walking)”
where participants walked to the other viewpoint, enabling continuous
egocentric updating of spatial relationships; (c) “shifted-viewpoint
(teleport)” where participants teleported, using the controller thumbpad button, to the other viewpoint, removing self-motion and environmental cues, thus requiring allocentric encoding due to disrupted
egocentric cues. Note that the teleportation included both a virtual
translation and rotation of the participants’ view. The environment
remained visible throughout all movement conditions and participants’
walking trajectories were guided by illuminated directional arrows
placed on the elevated L-shaped platform (see Supplemental Video).
During the walking movement conditions, participants were instructed
to keep their gaze aligned with the arrows on the elevated platform in
order to discourage any strategy of maintaining a constant visual
reference to the object’s previous location while walking. To minimize
differences in exposure durations across movement conditions, we
deliberately included a delay of 15 s from when the object disappeared
at the end of the encoding phase to when the first object was presented
back to participants during the retrieval phase. This duration was
determined based on a conservative estimate of average walking speed
(0.8 m/s) for older adults to traverse the maximum required distance
(∼12 m back and forth along the platform). This design decision
ensured that even in the teleportation condition, participants would
experience a minimum exposure time comparable to the walking
conditions.
Retrieval
After the movement condition, participants were prompted to
replace the previously seen objects. A virtual laser pointer was
activated, with a randomly selected object from the encoding phase
894
CASTEGNARO, DIOR, BURGESS, AND KING
appearing at its tip (Figure 1C). Participants aimed the laser at the
desired location and confirmed placement with the trigger button;
only one attempt was allowed per object. Objects were presented
one at a time, and replacement was entirely self-paced (no time limit
was imposed on the retrieval response).
Neuropsychological Tests
To ensure that any cognitive impairments observed were
within normal limits for aging, older participants underwent the
Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III. Only those scoring
above the established threshold of 88 out of 100 were included in
the study. Additionally, to facilitate comparisons between different testing modalities, older participants were also assessed
using a desktop version of an allocentric spatial memory test,
commonly known as the Four Mountains Test (Hartley et al.,
2007). This allowed us to directly compare performances on a
traditional desktop test proven to be hippocampal-dependent with
those on the immersive virtual reality test of allocentric spatial
memory.
Analysis
Preprocessing, visualization and analysis were performed using
Matlab Version 2020b. ANOVA analysis was conducted using SPSS.
Object Location Memory Performance
Prior to running parametric tests, all continuous variables were
checked for normality assumptions. Normality was assessed using the
Shapiro–Wilk test (Shapiro & Wilk, 1965; suitable for distributions
with n < 100 data points), alongside analyses of skewness and
kurtosis. For the mixed-design ANOVA, which explored the effects
of movement conditions and object configurations between young
and older controls, the Levene test confirmed equality of variances,
followed by Mauchly’s test of sphericity to check the assumption of
sphericity. Due to a temporary tracking system fault, five trials from
five participants in the older group were excluded.
Factors Influencing Memory for Object Locations
Within Different Movement Conditions and
Within Different Configurations
A mixed ANOVA design was used to assess the effects of
movement condition and object configuration on average displacement error, incorporating a three-way factor analysis within
groups (movement condition, object configuration, block number) and a between-group factor of age (young and older adults).
Analysis result for the block effect of the mixed ANOVA can be
found in the Supplemental Materials. Planned within-group contrasts
of the movement condition were performed using Helmert coding,
allowing for comparisons between the average displacement errors of
the same-viewpoint condition and the combined shifted-viewpoint
conditions (across walking and teleporting), and then specifically
between the two shifted-viewpoint conditions (walking vs. teleporting). Planned contrast on the different movement conditions
within groups have been conducted a simple contrast coding. With
this analysis choice the question asked, according to our hypothesis,
was (a) does movement to different viewpoints affect memory for
object locations? and (b) does a continuous spatial update of the one’s
movement positively affect the retrieval for object locations from
shifted viewpoints and does this benefit affect differently older individuals compared to younger ones?
To assess potential ceiling effects in performance in each movement condition, reflecting flooring effects in displacement errors, we
conducted an analysis of error distributions, including measures of
skewness, clustering near the theoretical minimum, and statistical
comparisons against the floor theoretical minimum (see Supplemental
Analysis). To ensure that skewed distributions did not influence the
statistical comparisons, we applied a log transformation to displacement errors (see Supplemental Analysis) before running the
mixed ANOVA analysis.
Association With Comparative Allocentric Memory Test
An explorative analysis looked at the relation between the Four
Mountains Test (4MT) score, which is a test of allocentric processing
(Hartley et al., 2007), and the Queen Square VR displacement errors.
Specifically, separate linear model has been fitted where the average
displacement error per participant in each movement condition is the
dependent variable and the score in the four mountains test is the
independent variable. Outliers effect was reduced using a robust linear
regression where the least-squares fitting is weighted using a Tukey’s
bisquare on each data point. A Bonferroni correction was applied to
account for multiple comparisons. Higher scores in 4MT are expected
to be correlated to lower displacement errors in the allocentric conditions of the Queen Square VR task.

Results
Differential Impact of Walking Versus Teleporting in
Shifted-Viewpoint Conditions Between Age Groups
We observed significant main effects on average displacement
error due to age group: F(1, 42) = 18.07, p < .001, = 0.30; Figure 2A,
object configuration: F(1, 42) = 63.95, p < .001, η2 p = 0.60;
Figure 2B, and movement condition: F(2, 41) = 34.25, p < .001,
η2 p = 0.45. A nonsignificant trend toward a main effect of block
number was observed ( p = .53, see Supplemental Results for
details). The older group performed worse (M = 1.61 m, SD =
0.61 m) than the young group (M = 0.91 m, SD = 0.46 m) across
all conditions. Performance was poorer in the four-object configuration (M = 1.55 m, SD = 0.70 m) compared to the single object (M =
1.00 m, SD = 0.66 m).
Helmert planned contrasts indicated better performance in the
same-viewpoint condition (M = 0.88 m, SD = 0.36 m) compared to
combined shifted-viewpoint conditions, M = 1.47 m, SD = 0.93 m;

Participant Performance (Displacement Error) Across Conditions
Note. All data are averaged over specified variables: (A) Performance by age group (young, older), averaged across object
configurations and movement conditions. (B) Performance by object configuration (one or four objects), averaged across age
groups and movement conditions. (C) Performance by movement condition, averaged across age groups and object configurations. (D) Performance by age group and movement condition, averaged across object configurations. Each violin plot was
generated using kernel density estimation to show the probability density of the data at different values. Each circle represents the
averaged displacement error for each participant. In each box, the large black dot marks the overall mean, and the dark grey bars
mark the median and the 25th and 75th percentiles. Observations beyond the whisker length are outliers. A mixed analysis of
variance revealed main effects of age group (A), object configuration (B) and movement condition (C) on displacement error.
Planned contrast analysis revealed better performance across age groups in the same-view condition compared to the combined
shifted-viewpoint conditions (C), and within shifted-viewpoint conditions, walking revealed better performance than teleporting
(C) and no interaction between block and participant group. An interaction effect between movement condition and age group
reveals that movement conditions did not affect the young group’s performance, while the older group performed best in the
same-view condition, better in shifted-viewpoint when walking instead of teleporting (X symbol, D). See the online article for
the color version of this figure.

indicating differential impacts by movement conditions across age
groups. Planned contrasts of the interaction effects revealed significant
performance differences among older participants. Specifically, they
performed significantly better in the same-viewpoint condition (M =
1.04 m, SD = 0.26 m) compared to both shifted-viewpoint conditions:

participants performed better when walking compared to teleporting,
t(22) = −6.16, p < .001, η2 p = 0.63. In contrast, the younger participants showed no significant differences between movement conditions (all ps > .05), indicating that movement conditions did not
affect their performance.
The interaction between object configuration and age group was
not statistically significant, F(1, 42) = 4.01, p = .052, η2 p = 0.09,
suggesting that the cognitive demands associated with increased
object configuration difficulty did not differ significantly between
the two age groups. The three-way interaction of movement condition, age group, and object configuration was not significant, nor
was the full four-way interaction including block number.

Direct assessment of potential ceiling effects revealed that while
younger adults exhibited some clustering toward lower values, performance was not constrained by a ceiling effect (see Supplemental
Results).
To ensure that skewed distributions did not influence the statistical
comparisons, we applied a log transformation to displacement errors
before re-running the mixed ANOVA (see Supplemental Results). All
main effects remained significant of age group, object configuration
and movement condition remained highly significant (all p’s < .001),
with increased effect sizes after transformation (age group: η2 p = 0.38;

compared to both shifted-viewpoint conditions (p < .01) but showed
no difference between walking and teleporting in the shifted-viewpoint
conditions. Older adults maintained the same performance pattern
observed in the original analysis.
Chance Performance and Retrieval Time Analysis
To assess if findings were driven by random guessing, we conducted a Supplemental Analysis to determine chance performance
levels (see Supplemental Materials for details). Using a bootstrapping
approach, we established that both young and older adults performed
well above chance levels across all movement conditions, including
the shifted-viewpoint (teleport) condition (Supplemental Figure S1).
In addition, an exploratory analysis examined the relationship
between retrieval time and displacement error (see Supplemental
Materials for details). While retrieval time was significantly longer in
older adults compared to young participants (Supplemental Figure
S5A), regression analyses revealed no significant relationship between
retrieval time and displacement error in either age group (Supplemental
Figure S5B).
Association With Desktop Version of Allocentric Spatial
Memory in Older Adults
Separate linear regression models were conducted for the older
group to explore the relationship between average displacement
error in each movement condition across object configurations of the
Queen Square VR task and the 4MT scores. We did not collect 4MT
data for younger adults as it was not part of the cognitive screening
procedure to ensure that participants were cognitively normal. After
adjusting for multiple comparisons, only the shifted-viewpoint
teleport condition, F(1, 21) = 15.2, p = .001, R2adjusted = 0.39;
Figure 3C, and the shifted-viewpoint walking condition, F(1, 21) =
12.6, p = .002, R2adjusted = 0.35; Figure 3B, showed significant
negative associations with 4MT scores after Bonferroni correction,
with the strongest effect observed in the teleport condition. For one
unit increase of the 4MT performance the average displacement
error decreased by 0.21 m in the shifted-viewpoint teleport condition
while it decreased by 0.14 m in the shifted-viewpoint walking
condition. The same-view condition approached significance but did
not survive the multiple comparison correction (Figure 3A).
Discussion
In this study, we investigated compensatory mechanisms in aging
on spatial memory for object locations from different viewpoints
using an immersive virtual reality task. Our main findings indicate
that performance worsened in conditions requiring shifted viewpoints, particularly in the teleport condition, and this effect was
primarily driven by the older participants. These findings suggest that

SELF-MOTION SUPPORTS SPATIAL MEMORY IN AGING

the ability to update spatial representations through self-motion plays
a critical role in mitigating age-related deficits in allocentric spatial
memory.
This work builds on extensive evidence that advancing age is
associated with deficits in spatial processing in tasks where a shift of
the participant viewpoint is involved (Fernandez-Baizan et al., 2020;
Leo´n et al., 2016; Tasco´n et al., 2019). In line with expectations,
participants were most accurate at object replacement when using the
same viewpoint. Consistent with our hypothesis, in the shiftedviewpoint conditions, walking resulted in significantly better object
replacement compared to teleporting—where self-motion cues are
removed (Figure 2C). While allocentric representations are available in
all three conditions, an egocentric representation might better explain
the pattern of results. In the same-view condition, both egocentric and
allocentric representations are available, allowing participants to
accurately recall object locations. In the shifted-viewpoint walking
condition, participants can update their egocentric representations
through vestibular input, optic flow, and proprioception to maintain
spatial accuracy. However, in the shifted-viewpoint teleport condition,
the instantaneous change in position and orientation prevents the
updating of egocentric representations leaving participants to rely on
allocentric representations to recall object locations. Although it is
theoretically possible that participants could have engaged in imagined
perspective-taking to maintain egocentric representations following
teleportation, the cost associated with such mental transformations is
known to increase sharply with angular disparity, peaking near 120°,
which is closely matched by the ∼125° shift in our teleport condition
(Puls & May, 2020). In immersive VR, this cost is likely compounded
by continuous sensory-motor input tied to participants’ real-world
movements, which after teleportation may disrupt imagined realignment. Therefore, in the absence of continuous self-motion, participants
were likely unable to rely on egocentric strategies alone.
Notably, while this pattern of decreased performance in shifted
viewpoints was present across age groups (Supplemental Figure
S3C)—reflecting the known baseline cost of perspective shifts even
in young adults (Kelly & McNamara, 2010; Zancada-Menendez et
al., 2016)—it was primarily driven by older participants (Figure
2D). The improved performance of older adults in the walking
condition suggests that they effectively use self-motion information
to update their egocentric representations, thereby compensating for
weaker allocentric representations. In contrast, the absence of selfmotion cues in the teleportation condition prevents this egocentric
updating, leading older adults to rely solely on their weaker allocentric representations, resulting in increased errors.
Accounting for potential ceiling effects, particularly affecting
performance in the young cohort, revealed that key effects not only
remained significant but also showed stronger effect sizes (see
Supplemental Results for details). Specifically, while both age groups
showed performance decrements in shifted-viewpoint conditions,
only older adults demonstrated a significant additional impairment
when teleportation was used instead of walking (Supplemental Figure
S3C). This pattern supports the interpretation that in shifted-viewpoint
conditions, continuous self-motion information during walking provides significant benefits for spatial memory in older adults, enabling
them to maintain better allocentric representations compared to
teleportation. In contrast, younger adults can effectively compensate
for the absence of such information during teleportation, exhibiting
similar performance regardless of movement type when viewpoints
change. Importantly, we ruled out that systematic directional biases
induced by viewpoint shifts—previously identified in desktop VR and
particularly pronounced in older participants (Segen et al., 2021)—
could provide an alternative explanation for the age- and movementrelated differences (see Supplemental Analysis). Specifically, our
analysis (Supplemental Table S1) revealed no significant effects or
interactions on projected directional errors, indicating that systematic
directional biases were not present in this task and did not contribute to
the observed pattern of increased errors among older adults in teleport
compared to walking conditions (Supplemental Figure S4).
Previous work indicates that age-related allocentric decline is not
uniform across paradigms (Hill et al., 2024; McAvan et al., 2021;
Segen, Avraamides, et al., 2022). McAvan et al. (2021) showed that
older adults can return accurately to a single hidden location in an
ambulatory virtual Morris Water Maze; their task emphasizes path
integration—updating the coordinates of a location that was previously visited—whereas our paradigm emphasizes spatial updating
of one or more object locations relative to the broader environment
without visiting those locations, a process that imposes a heavier
representational load than tracking a single goal (Jahn et al., 2012;
Wraga et al., 2000). In addition, McAvan et al. (2021) provided
repeated training trials from multiple starting points before testing,
whereas in our study each configuration had to be encoded on a single
exposure and for a given time; the allocentric weakness we found
might therefore be overcome when older adults can rehearse the layout
(Castegnaro et al., 2022; Jansen et al., 2009; Sauzéon et al., 2016).
Similarly, a desktop-VR viewpoint-shift study reported preserved
accuracy in aging, yet the perspective rotation was 30°, smaller
than the ∼90–145° shifts that reveal allocentric deficits in the present
experiment and in other work (King et al., 2002; Muffato et al.,
2019; Puls & May, 2020; Reinoso Medina et al., 2025; ZancadaMenendez et al., 2016). In addition, their task required a binary
same/different judgment, whereas our task requires a continuous,
metric reconstruction of the entire configuration. Because coarse
categorical decisions can often be solved through recognition-based
familiarity, such tasks might place weaker demands on allocentric
recollection (Bastin & Van der Linden, 2005; Muffato et al., 2022).
Together, we argue that allocentric decline is most evident when (a)
multiple object/landmark relations must be encoded in a single shot
and (b) the perspective shift exceeds a certain threshold at which
mental-rotation or recognition strategies become taxing. Future
studies should take these boundary conditions into account when
designing and interpreting spatial memory tasks across the adult
lifespan.
To our best knowledge, this study is the first to explicitly link the
weakness in allocentric strategies in older adults to continuous
self-motion updates of spatial relationships using virtual reality,
highlighting spatial updating as a mechanism that can help older
adults to compensate for allocentric decline. We also examined
whether older adults’ longer retrieval times (Supplemental Figure
S5A) reflected greater uncertainty or a different response strategy
rather than broader cognitive decline. However, our Supplemental
Analysis (Supplemental Figure S5B) found no significant relationship
between retrieval time and displacement error in either age group.
Processing-speed theory propose that a central factor in adult cognitive aging is a reduction in the speed with which basic processing
operations can be carried out, manifesting as longer completion times
across a wide variety of tasks (Salthouse, 1996; Salthouse & FerrerCaja, 2003). Thus, the prolonged retrieval times found in older adults
898
CASTEGNARO, DIOR, BURGESS, AND KING
likely reflect this domain-general slowing rather than higher uncertainty or different response strategies.
The difficulties found by the older adults in the walking condition
may be reflected within the normal range of aging in the decline of
functionalities of the entorhinal cortex (Stangl et al., 2018) within the
medial temporal lobe which support intrinsic self-motion related
computations (Hafting et al., 2005; Sargolini et al., 2006). In addition,
in the teleportation condition, where self-motion cues are absent,
participants must rely more on allocentric processing to recall object
locations. This allocentric processing is supported by brain structures
such as the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex (Burgess et al.,
2002; Maguire, Burgess, et al., 1998; Maguire, Frith, et al., 1998), and
the retrosplenial cortex which plays a key role in shifted-viewpoint
memory (Bicanski & Burgess, 2016; Lambrey et al., 2012; Mitchell et
al., 2018). Age-related decline in these structures, evidenced by a
reduced activation when performing allocentric processing in navigation (Antonova et al., 2009; Moffat et al., 2006) could explain the
greater accuracy difference observed in older participants between the
walking and teleportation conditions.
A potential confounding factor in the observed deficit among older
participants in the shifted-viewpoint (walking) condition may be agerelated deterioration in the vestibular system. This deterioration can
divert attention from navigation tasks to balance and postural control
(Arshad & Seemungal, 2016), potentially reducing the attentional
resources available for spatial updating. Teleportation, especially
when involving both translational and rotational body-based cues, can
induce disorientation (Cherep et al., 2020) due to abrupt changes in
both position and orientation. However, our analysis confirmed
performance above random guessing for both age groups, including
teleportation (Supplemental Figure S1). This confirms that older
adults’ increased errors in teleportation were not due to random
responses but instead reflect difficulties in recalling object locations
when self-motion cues were absent. The presence of environmental
boundaries in our VR environment likely mitigated disorientation, as
boundaries have been shown to help maintain orientation during
teleportation (Kelly et al., 2022). We did not find any improvement of
performance over time (Supplemental Figure S2), indicating that
participants could adjust to the VR environment after the training
phase. In this study, we did not record tracking data from the headmounted display, which could have provided proxies for balance and
posture. Future studies should consider incorporating such measures
to monitor vestibular function during VR tasks, thereby controlling
for potential vestibular deficits.
Our findings regarding the differential effects of teleporting and
walking-induced viewpoint shifts in older adults may reflect distinctions between modality-dependent and modality-independent
spatial representations (Huffman & Ekstrom, 2019; Steel et al., 2021).
Modality-dependent spatial representations refer to spatial knowledge
inherently tied to the sensory-motor modality through which it was
originally encoded, requiring the reactivation of specific sensorymotor systems during spatial recall. Conversely, modality-independent, or amodal, spatial representations describe abstract cognitive
maps that are not significantly influenced by the original encoding
modality, allowing spatial knowledge to be expressed flexibly across
different sensory modalities. In our study, older adults exhibited
greater errors when teleporting disrupted the continuity of sensorymotor experiences compared to viewpoint shifts involving walking,
consistent with an embodied cognition perspective emphasizing
the integration of multimodal sensory information during spatial
navigation. Previous studies indicate that multimodal sensory inputs
significantly contribute to the formation of coherent spatial representations, particularly aiding in allocentric spatial memory performance in aged populations (Hill et al., 2024; McAvan et al., 2021)
and in recruiting extrahippocampal strategies as shown in hippocampal lesion patients (Iggena et al., 2023). The instantaneous shift in
viewpoint due to teleporting likely interrupts the integration of these
multimodal cues, necessitating reliance on more abstract, amodal
representations, which are less effectively maintained by older adults.
This suggests not only that multimodal inputs enhance spatial memory
performance, particularly under limited cognitive resources associated
with aging (Huffman & Ekstrom, 2019), but also that these sensory
inputs naturally form a unified representation in the brain, which is
vulnerable to instantaneous discontinuities such as those introduced
by teleporting (Steel et al., 2021). In contrast, younger participants,
who typically show more efficient integration of sensory-motor
information, exhibited no performance differences between teleporting and walking conditions, reflecting a resilience in both egocentric spatial updating and the modality-independent representation
of spatial layouts. These findings underline the importance of multimodal integration in spatial memory and suggest that age-related
declines may impair the ability to flexibly shift between modalitydependent and modality-independent spatial representations.
Older adults’ performance on the Queen Square VR task was
strongly correlated with performance on the 4MT, a hippocampaldependent allocentric spatial memory assessment requiring landscapes
to be recognized from a shifted viewpoint on the basis of topographical
layout rather than visual appearance (see Figure 3; Hartley et al.,
2007). Notably, both shifted-viewpoint conditions showed significant
associations with 4MT scores, but the strongest effect was observed in
the teleport condition. This finding highlights the link between allocentric spatial processing and performance in the Queen Square VR
task, suggesting that the teleport condition most effectively isolates
allocentric demands when self-motion cues are removed. These results
support the association between age-related deficits, hippocampal
function and suggest how the task proposed in this study supports
amodal representations related to allocentric cognitive processing.
The higher cognitive load associated with remembering multiple
object locations was found in the difference in performance (Figure 1B)
between different object configuration, however, both young and older
participants struggled similarly when memorizing four-object locations
compared to one. This suggests that within our cohort, age-related
decline did not significantly impact the ability to work with multiple
objects within a scene, and the observed differences in movement
conditions were not due to more general age-related declines in
working memory capacity (Castillo Escamilla et al., 2023).
Impairments in allocentric processing (Serino et al., 2014) and
path integration (Segen, Ying, et al., 2022) have been observed early
in the progression to Alzheimer’s dementia. Thus, future research
could employ shifted-viewpoint tasks that assess both allocentric
and self-motion related processing to investigate which is specifically impaired in patients with mild cognitive impairment with an
incipient cause of Alzheimer’s dementia. Since the anterolateral
entorhinal cortex—a region implicated early in neurodegeneration
(Braak & Del Tredici, 2015)—is critical for processing object locations within contexts (Olsen et al., 2017; Yeung et al., 2019),
deficits in self-motion-related updating might be instrumental in
stratifying patients according to Alzheimer’s dementia progression.
SELF-MOTION SUPPORTS SPATIAL MEMORY IN AGING
899
The present study has limitations. The sample size, though
powered for detecting medium-sized effects, could have masked
ceiling effects among younger participants or nonnormal distributions, potentially influencing the robustness and generalizability of
our statistical analyses. Another limitation is the absence of precise
timing data for each movement phase that could reveal extra time
spent by participants re-orienting themselves—particularly after
teleportation. We enforced a fixed minimum time between encoding
and retrieval and we did not impose any upper limit on object
replacement, ensuring each participant had an equal opportunity to reorient before placing the objects. Since retrieval time was not
associated with displacement error in either age group (Supplemental
Figure S5B), it is unlikely that faster or longer exploratory scanning
could account for the observed age differences. Nonetheless, without
continuous head-mounted display tracking we cannot exclude the
possibility that younger adults engaged in more extensive visual
scanning after teleportation—potentially allowing them to reacquire
spatial landmarks more effectively and re-establish their environmental orientation. Future work should systematically integrate headmounted display tracking to disentangle scanning behaviors from
memory performance. In line with the previous point, the absence of
head-mounted display tracking data could have directly confirmed
participants’ head orientation throughout the task, particularly during
walking movements. Such data would be necessary to assess whether
participants attempted to hold a constant visual reference to the
previous object location—thereby reducing the need for spatial updating via self-motion cues. Although our design features, including
directional arrows and the spatially scattered object configurations,
likely reduced this behavior, future research would benefit from
incorporating tracking to quantify it.
In conclusion, the Queen Square VR task effectively detects agerelated declines in spatial memory, with older adults showing significant impairments in the shifted-viewpoint tasks, and specifically
when updating of egocentric representations via self-motion cannot
be used to compensate for weak allocentric representation. These
findings highlight the role of spatial updating in mitigating spatial
memory deficits in aging.
