and Communication Technology (ICT) Literacy Across
Adulthood: A Two-Wave Study

Despite the increasing importance of digital skills in modern society, the development of information
and communication technology (ICT) literacy in adulthood has received limited attention, particularly
regarding gender differences over the course of life. Therefore, this study investigated between-person
differences and within-person changes in ICT literacy over approximately 9 years in a sample of N =
2,266 adults from Germany. The result showed that younger adults exhibited higher ICT literacy than
older adults, but within-person changes did not differ by age. On average, ICT literacy declined over
time (Cohen’s d = −0.30). Men consistently demonstrated higher ICT literacy than women (Cohen’s
d = 0.39), though gender did not influence changes in ICT literacy. Socioeconomic status did not
robustly moderate these effects. These findings suggest that ICT literacy tends to decline across
adulthood, while preexisting gender differences, likely rooted in earlier socialization processes, persist
without substantial change.
Public Significance Statement
The study showed that younger adults and men exhibited higher information and communication
technology literacy than older adults and women. While information and communication technology
literacy declined over 9 years in all age groups, the gender gap was stable over 9 years.

Modern society is increasingly centered around online collaboration, remote learning, and digital work. In this context, the ability
to effectively use information and communication technologies
(ICT) is becoming more and more important. As individuals
progress through different stages of adolescence and adulthood,
their digital proficiencies can have a great impact on their educational attainment, employment opportunities, and overall quality
of life (e.g., Chen et al., 2022; Lei et al., 2021; Livingstone et al.,
2023). The development of digital competences across the life
course has, however, received limited attention thus far, with some
notable exceptions focusing on children and adolescents (Gnambs,
2021; Lazonder et al., 2020; Senkbeil, 2022). But an understanding
of how disparities in digital competencies, such as ICT literacy,
emerge and persist across different life stages is essential for the
development of effective interventions to reduce barriers for digital
participation and to systematically address skill improvement.
Cross-sectional research indicates that older adults are often at a
disadvantage when it comes to digital skills (Llorente-Barroso et al.,
2023; Olsson et al., 2019; Papí-Gálvez & La Parra-Casado, 2023; A.
J. M. Van Deursen & van Dijk, 2019). This can have far-reaching
implications such as difficulties in accessing essential online services,
participating in the digital economy, maintaining independent living,
and staying connected with family and friends. To gain a deeper
understanding of how disparities in digital competencies emerge or
change across adulthood, it is important to consider individual
characteristics that contribute to and perpetuate these inequalities.
One determinant that has been shown to contribute to digital disparities, at least among children and adolescents, is gender (Campos &

Scherer, 2024; Qazi et al., 2022; Siddiq & Scherer, 2019). Whether
gender disparities can also explain changes in the digital divide among
adults, however, is the focus of the present research. Adopting a
developmental perspective, the study examines within-person changes
in ICT literacy across approximately 9 years in a random sample of
German adults aged between 26 and 67 years. The analyses focus on
differential change trajectories for men and women to investigate
gender-dependent heterogeneity in ICT literacy.
Information and Communication Technology Literacy
The concept of ICT literacy refers to a broad set of cognitive and
technical skills required for the proficient use of digital technologies
and communication tools, such as computers, smartphones, and
internet platforms, to access, manage, integrate, evaluate, create,
and communicate information in digital environments (Educational
Testing Service, 2002). This definition outlines six key components
of ICT literacy which are adopted in the theoretical frameworks of
numerous international large-scale assessments (e.g., Fraillon &
Duckworth, 2025; Senkbeil et al., 2013). The first component
(access) pertains to the ability to operate diverse devices and
software applications, enabling individuals to efficiently search for
and retrieve information from digital sources. The capacity to
organize and store digital information effectively (maintain) is an
important requirement for individuals to be able to handle large
volumes of data. The ability to synthesize information from multiple
digital sources (integrate) enables individuals to compare, analyze,
and combine content in meaningful ways. Furthermore, the ability to
critically assess digital information (evaluate) allows individuals to
determine the credibility, accuracy, and relevance of digital resources.
Finally, ICT literacy encompasses the ability to produce new content
using digital tools (create) and to share information effectively across
diverse digital platforms (communicate). These components emphasize that ICT literacy goes beyond basic technical proficiency. It
reflects a comprehensive ability to use digital tools and successfully
manipulate information.
The precise components subsumed under ICT literacy, however,
can vary depending on the adopted theoretical framework (e.g.,
Fraillon & Duckworth, 2025; Van Laar et al., 2017; Vuorikari et al.,
2022). Adult literacy research, for example, frequently focuses on
problem-solving abilities in technology-rich environments (Kirsch
& Lennon, 2017) which emphasizes individuals’ ability to solve
practical, work-related tasks in digital contexts, like filling out forms
or troubleshooting software. But it does not cover informationrelated competencies, such as the ability to locate, process, and
communicate information effectively (see Table 1). Newer definitions of ICT literacy, on the other hand, sometimes expand the scope
of the concept to include additional skills, such as computational
thinking or the ethical and responsible use of digital technologies
(e.g., Fraillon & Duckworth, 2025; Vuorikari et al., 2022). In some
cases, ICT literacy is also viewed as part of a more expansive set of
21st century skills, which also encompass soft skills like creativity
and critical thinking (Kain et al., 2024; Van Laar et al., 2017). The
concept of ICT literacy has also significant overlap with related
terms, such as critical online reasoning (Molerov et al., 2020), data
literacy (Gebre, 2022), algorithmic literacy (Oeldorf-Hirsch &
Neubaum, 2025), or artificial intelligence literacy (Pinski & Benlian,
2024), which can result in jingle-jangle fallacies or a déjà-variable
phenomenon (see Hanfstingl et al., 2024; Rubach, 2024)—whereby
different concepts are labeled similarly or identical terms are used

refer to different concepts (see Table 1). Despite the ambiguity in
terms, most definitions concur that ICT literacy is a general competence that comprises both declarative knowledge about digital
technologies and procedural abilities that enable individuals to use
digital environments effectively (Senkbeil, 2022; Senkbeil et al.,
2013).
ICT Literacy in Adulthood
Digital technologies permeate nearly every aspect of daily
activities, work, and societal participation. Therefore, proficiency in
the use of ICT has become essential for routine tasks such as online
banking, telehealth consultations, and digital communication. In the
workplace, ICT literacy is critical for maintaining competitiveness
in the job market (Van Laar et al., 2017). Workers across diverse
sectors are increasingly required to demonstrate proficiency in
complex software systems such as platforms for data management,
project management, and digital collaboration. Consequently,
higher ICT skills have become a sought-after competence in the
workplace, leading to better employability and higher wages (e.g.,
Eggenberger & Backes-Gellner, 2023; Falck et al., 2021). Notably,
also older workers with stronger ICT skills often experience
significant monetary returns, emphasizing the importance of digital
competences throughout the life course (Lee et al., 2022). Beyond the
professional realm, ICT literacy is also critical for preventing social
exclusion (Ragnedda et al., 2022). By helping individuals to stay
connected through digital communication platforms, individuals can
maintain relationships with family, friends, and broader social networks, thus reducing the risk of social isolation that often accompanies aging. Consequently, those lacking adequate ICT skills are at a
significant disadvantage in their personal and professional lives,
underscoring the importance of ICT literacy for full participation in
today’s digital society.
At the same time, numerous studies identified a substantial digital
divide in terms of access to, literacy in, and benefits derived from
digital technologies (see Estrela et al., 2023; Siddiq & Scherer, 2019;
Scherer & Siddiq, 2019; Qazi et al., 2022, for meta-analytic evidence). This divide often follows along demographic lines, with age
being a particularly important factor (e.g., Ertl et al., 2020; Olsson
et al., 2019; Papí-Gálvez & La Parra-Casado, 2023; A. J. M. Van
Deursen & van Dijk, 2019). Age tends to increase the digital divide on
at least three levels. The first level refers to reduced access to digital
devices and the internet among older individuals. Although this firstlevel digital divide has diminished in recent decades and the majority
of adults now have at least basic technical access to ICT (Vuorre &
Przybylski, 2024; Zilian & Zilian, 2020), older adults still tend to own
fewer types of digital devices and often have more limited internet
access options compared to younger individuals (Quittschalle et al.,
2020; A. J. M. Van Deursen & van Dijk, 2019). The second-level
digital divide concerns disparities in digital skills. Older adults often
have less exposure to formal ICT education and less frequent
technology use over their lifetimes which can contribute to reduced
proficiency in using modern technologies (e.g., Olsson et al., 2019).
Some studies seem to support this conjecture showing lower ICT
skills among older as compared to younger age groups (Van Laar
et al., 2020). The respective age gap in ICT literacy is sometimes even
larger as respective gaps for more traditional competence domains
such as numeracy or reading (Ertl et al., 2020). The third level of the
digital divide pertains to tangible benefits derived from digital media
use. As age increases, individuals tend to reap less benefits from
online activities such as digital communication than younger individuals (Van Deursen & Helsper, 2018). Taken together, the
available findings suggest generational differences in the digital
divide on all three levels. So far, it is unclear whether the observed
increase in the digital divide of ICT literacy is a consequence of
different socializations within different age groups or developmental
processes associated with different life stages.
Gender Differences in ICT Literacy
According to widely shared gender norms, that is, simplistic and
generalized beliefs about how men and women are expected to
behave in certain contexts (Ellemers, 2018), modern technologies
and computers are traditionally perceived as stereotypically male
domains, where women are expected to perform less proficiently
(Sieverding & Koch, 2009). The resulting gendered socialization
processes then contribute to differences in interests and ICT skills
between genders (see also Eccles & Wigfield’s, 2002, situated
expectancy value theory). Such gendered stereotypes can also
influence individuals’ self-perceptions, which, in turn, shape their
engagement with ICT (Tellhed et al., 2023). Studies have shown that
women frequently rate their digital competence lower than men do
(Cai et al., 2017), even when controlling for their actual ICT skills
(Gnambs, 2021). This tendency to undervalue their ICT skills can
then negatively impact their digital engagement and impair further
skill development (Senkbeil, 2022).
While the expansion of mobile devices and digital services may
have shifted these stereotypical perceptions to some degree, reducing
the automatic association between ICT and men, gender differences in
usage patterns remain (Bünning et al., 2023). In addition, women tend
to shoulder a disproportionate share of domestic and caregiving
responsibilities, leading to longer total work time per week compared
to men (Kan et al., 2022), which might limit their time to develop
digital skills. Men, on the other hand, are still more likely to work fulltime and hold technical occupations, providing them with more
opportunities to acquire and practice ICT skills. This pattern is
particularly evident among older adults, where women may have
less exposure to ICT tasks due to less frequent engagement in
digital activities at work, while men may make more frequent use
of digital tools, which further reinforces their ICT competences
(Bünning et al., 2023). In addition, more rigid gender stereotypes
that were more prevalent some decades ago (Eagly et al., 2020),
might further impact older women’s technology-related self-efficacy
and, thus, their willingness to engage with digital environments.
A broad body of research on gender differences in ICT literacy
revealed, however, rather inconsistent findings. Among adolescents,
some meta-analytic reviews showed higher ICT literacy among boys
than girls (Long et al., 2023; Qazi et al., 2022), while others found
reverse effects (Campos & Scherer, 2024; Siddiq & Scherer, 2019).
Some research also suggests that gender differences in ICT literacy
gradually emerge during adolescence. For example, Gnambs (2021)
found negligible gender differences in ICT literacy disadvantaging
boys at age 15, which grew more pronounced by age 18. In contrast,
research on adult populations often showed that men tend to outperform women in areas like computer literacy and certain ICT skills
(Long et al., 2023; Martínez-Cantos, 2017; Van Laar et al., 2020),
although not consistently in all studies (Ertl et al., 2020). Some
studies even indicate that the gender gap seems to be larger among

older people (Long et al., 2023). Taken together, the available
findings point to notable gender differences in the digital divide,
though the specific direction and magnitude of these effects vary
across studies and age groups. While there is substantial research on
adolescent ICT literacy, much less is known about how these gender
differences develop throughout the life course. It remains unclear
whether the gap between men’s and women’s digital skills widens
over time, particularly in adulthood and older age.
Objectives and Research Questions
Most research on ICT literacy has been conducted from a crosssectional perspective, predominately focusing on adolescence (e.g.,
Campos & Scherer, 2024; Lei et al., 2021; Livingstone et al., 2023;
Siddiq & Scherer, 2019). However, there is limited knowledge
about how ICT literacy evolves across the life course, particularly in
adulthood. The present study aims to address this gap by investigating
changes in ICT literacy within a diverse sample of adults aged 26–67
years from Germany. Rather than simply examining between-person
differences, this study emphasizes within-person changes in ICT
literacy over a period of approximately 9 years. The research is guided
by three major research questions (RQ).
Social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986) postulates that positive
experiences with a task enhance self-efficacy, that is, an individual’s
confidence in their ability to successfully perform similar tasks in
the future. Higher self-efficacy can, in turn, boost motivation to
engage in progressively challenging tasks, which allow for new
learning opportunities. Similar assumptions are formulated in practice
engagement theory (Reder et al., 2020) which assumes that individual’s proficiencies develop as a by-product of their engagement
in practices at work, in the family, during leisure or other contexts.
The thereby acquired proficiency affects the willingness to engage in
such activities in return. Applied to ICT literacy, this theory suggests
two dynamics: a generational divide between individuals, as older
generations were exposed to fewer opportunities to engage with new
technologies earlier in life, and lifelong growth within individuals, as
the accumulation of experiences with digital technologies continues
throughout life. In line with these assumptions and respective crosssectional research (e.g., Olsson et al., 2019; Papí-Gálvez & La ParraCasado, 2023; A. J. M. Van Deursen & van Dijk, 2019), we therefore
expect to observe pronounced differences in ICT literacy between age
groups at the initial measurement. Younger individuals are likely to
demonstrate higher digital skills compared to older adults, with ICT
skills gradually declining with the age of the respondents. In addition,
also within-person ICT literacy is expected to increase, on average,
over the observational period, as digital technologies become more
integral to daily life. The necessity of using devices such as smartphones or computers for work and personal tasks has grown substantially, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase
in the use of digital technologies may have contributed to increases
in ICT literacy in the population. However, since older adults tend
to use digital devices less frequently (Quittschalle et al., 2020; A. J.
M. Van Deursen & van Dijk, 2019) and are more likely to be retired,
we expect younger participants to show greater increases in ICT
literacy over the 9-year period compared to older individuals.
RQ1a: ICT literacy at baseline decreases with the individuals’ age.
RQ1b: ICT literacy increases within individuals across
measurement waves, but less so with increasing age.
Despite inconsistent findings on a gender gap in ICT literacy,
particularly among youths (Campos & Scherer, 2024; Qazi et al.,
2022; Siddiq & Scherer, 2019), studies on adults generally indicated
that men tend to exhibit higher digital skills than women (Long
et al., 2023; Martínez-Cantos, 2017; Van Laar et al., 2020). It is also
plausible to assume that gender disparities in ICT literacy are more
pronounced among older adults, who were more exposed to traditional gender roles for a longer time (Eagly et al., 2020). In addition,
ICT literacy may increase more strongly among men than within
women over time because men are more likely to be in full-time
employment, often in technical fields. In contrast, women who are
more frequently employed part-time and bear greater domestic and
caregiving responsibilities (Kan et al., 2022) may have fewer
opportunities to develop ICT skills (Bünning et al., 2023).
RQ2a: ICT literacy at baseline is higher for men than women,
more so for older individuals.
RQ2b: The increase in ICT literacy within persons across
measurement waves is stronger for men as compared to women.
Gender does not influence skill development in isolation but
interacts with other social categories such as ethnicity or social
class (Codiroli Mcmaster & Cook, 2019; Collins, 2015). For
example, individuals with higher cultural capital are often exposed
to more egalitarian gender roles at work and their social circle and,
thus, are less likely to accept traditional gender stereotypes (Davis &
Greenstein, 2009). Women from higher socioeconomic backgrounds
are also more likely to pursue careers in traditionally male-dominated
fields such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
(Codiroli Mcmaster, 2017). As a result, it is plausible that gender
differences in ICT literacy are smaller among individuals with
higher socioeconomic status, who are also more exposed to
diverse technologies as part of their work, than among those with
lower status.
RQ3a: The gender difference in ICT literacy at baseline
decreases with the socioeconomic status of the respondents.
RQ3b: The gender difference in ICT literacy growth within
persons is smaller among individuals with higher socioeconomic status than those with lower status.
Most existing research on ICT literacy focuses on mean differences between social groups, such as men and women, while the
distribution of ICT literacy within these groups, that is, the extent to
which digital skills vary, remains unexplored. Research on cognitive
abilities, however, indicates pronounced variance in cognitive
functioning between the genders, with men more often observed at
both tails of the competence distribution and women exhibiting more
homogenous cognitive profiles (Hyde, 2014; Johnson et al., 2008).
So far, it is unclear whether these findings also extend to ICT literacy
and how factors such as age and socioeconomic status influence
the variability of digital skills among men and women. Since there is
no prior research on this topic and limited theoretical guidance for
formulating precise hypotheses, we adopt an exploratory approach

to examine the role of gender, age, and socioeconomic status in

Supplemental Material A.
Sample and Procedure
The National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) is an ongoing
longitudinal study that follows representative samples of the German
population over the course of their lives (Blossfeld & Roßbach,
2019). Participants in the adult cohort, the focus of the present study,
were selected using a two-stage cluster sampling approach to cover
the target population of people living in Germany born between 1944
and 1986 (see Aßmann et al., 2019 for details). They received annual
surveys and cognitive tests in their private homes, administered by
experienced interviewers from a professional survey institute. For this
study, N = 2,266 respondents (49% women) who participated in
the assessment of digital competencies were considered. The first
assessment was conducted between October 2013 and April 2014,
while the second assessment window was between September 2021
and April 2022. The median time between the two assessments was
8.92 years (Min = 8.47, Max = 9.46). The age of the participants in the
first wave was roughly evenly distributed between 26 and 67 years,
with a mean of 48.22 years (SD = 9.66). They had an average of 14.80
years of education and most of them (85%) were employed in different occupations. The occupations of the respondents’ covered a
wide range, including both blue-collar and white-collar jobs, with
about 52% of the participants working in high-skilled occupations
(i.e., International Standard Classification of Occupations 1–3)
according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations
(International Labour Organization, 2012). About 7% of the participants had a migrant background, meaning that they or at least one
of their parents were born outside Germany. Most of them (70%)
reported that they were married.
Instruments
ICT Literacy
ICT literacy was measured with achievement tests developed
specifically for the NEPS. Following established frameworks
from international large-scale assessments (e.g., Educational
Testing Service, 2002), the study adopted a literacy concept that
focuses on the relevance of competencies for successful participation in modern societies. ICT literacy was conceptualized as a
unidimensional construct based on the Educational Testing Service’s
(2002) definition, which refers to four process components (i.e.,
accessing, creating, managing, and evaluating information; see
Senkbeil et al., 2013 for details). Each item referred to one or two
process components and presented realistic problems to be solved
using a software application. Therefore, all items integrated common technologies such as an internet browser, a search engine, or a
spreadsheet into the task stimulus. The tests administered at the
two measurement occasions contained 29 and 19 multiple-choice
items, respectively, with up to six response options, including one
correct option. Each item was scored as correct or incorrect. The
second test also contained 14 interactive items (see Gnambs &
Senkbeil, 2023). These represented software simulations that required
participants to interact with technology and complete several steps to
achieve a goal (e.g., open a web browser, navigate through a menu
structure). The number of successful task completions represented the
item score.
On the first measurement occasion, all respondents received all
items of the test. In contrast, the second test used a multistage design
(Pohl, 2013). Thus, each respondent received only a subset of 20
items, depending on their responses during the test. The test was
administered on article in the first wave and on computer in the
second wave. Both assessments were conducted individually at the
respondents’ homes, supervised by experienced test administrators.
In both waves, the test time was limited to 28 min.
Both tests were scaled using the unidimensional partial credit
model (Masters, 1982). Item responses at each wave showed a good
fit to the item response model, essential unidimensionality, and
negligible differential item functioning across various subgroups
(see Gnambs & Senkbeil, 2023; Senkbeil & Ihme, 2015). Additional
analyses reported in Supplemental Material B also confirmed the
approximate measurement invariance of both tests across gender,
age, and socioeconomic status. The marginal reliabilities of the tests
were .80 and .71, respectively. To allow longitudinal mean-level
comparisons, the two tests were placed on a common scale across
waves using an independent bridge study in which respondents
received both tests at the same time (see Gnambs & Senkbeil, 2023).
The bridge study allowed both tests to be scaled concurrently, and
then the tests administered in the present sample to be placed on a
common metric using a mean/mean linking approach (see Fischer
et al., 2016 for more details). Respondents’ digital competencies
were given by 100 plausible values that were drawn for each
respondent and allow acknowledging the uncertainty in the
measurements (see Supplemental Material C).
Gender
The gender of the respondents was measured as a self-rating with
two response options (0 = male, 1 = female). Additional gender
categories (e.g., nonbinary) were not presented. However, respondents were allowed to skip the question without providing
an answer.
Socioeconomic Status
Following previous research (Antonoplis, 2023), two indicators
were created to represent socioeconomic status, namely, years in
education and occupational prestige. As these two indicators are
likely to vary with the age of the respondent (e.g., people get better
jobs as they progress in their careers), information on socioeconomic status was used when the respondent was 30 years old. This
age roughly corresponds to the age of the youngest participants in
the sample and is also an age at which most people have completed

their education and have a job. As the NEPS aims to collect
complete educational and occupational histories for all respondents,
information on socioeconomic status was reconstructed from the
biographical data for a respondent at a given age.
The years in education of each respondent at age 30 were derived
from an internationally comparable classification of educational
qualifications (Brauns et al., 2003). Years of education represent the
average number of years required to obtain a given qualification
(e.g., bachelor’s degree). The indicator can take values between 9
(equivalent to compulsory schooling) and 18 (equivalent to a
master’s degree from a university). Doctoral degrees are not separately coded in this measure and, thus, are included in the highest
category. Occupational prestige at age 30 was given by the international socioeconomic index of occupational status (Ganzeboom,
2010), which is derived from the respondent’s job while taking into
account the education required for the job and the income received.
The international socioeconomic index of occupational status ranges
from 10 (e.g., cleaning staff) to 98 (e.g., judges), with higher values
reflecting higher socioeconomic status. For respondents out of the
labor force at the age of 30, the corresponding values were taken from
jobs held in adjacent years (i.e., between the ages of 27 and 33).
Auxiliary Variables
Control variables used in the analyses included the time lag (in
years) between the two measurements of ICT literacy. In addition,
the sampling weights provided in the NEPS were used to adjust for
unequal sampling probabilities (see Hammon et al., 2016).
Statistical Analyses
The research questions were addressed using latent location-scale
change score analyses, which model the latent competence scores
at baseline and latent difference scores between the two measurements. Although an ongoing debate revolves around the appropriate
analysis strategy for longitudinal two-wave data (e.g., Castro-Schilo
& Grimm, 2018), there is a growing consensus that change score
analyses are often preferable because they allow controlling for
unobserved confounders (Lüdtke & Robitzsch, 2025). Age differences in ICT literacy at baseline and their change over 9 years were
examined by regressing the competence scores at the first measurement and the difference between the two measurements on age.
Potential nonlinear age trajectories were evaluated using piecewise
age models that specified different linear age trajectories for five age
groups (i.e., up to 30 years, between 30 and 40 years, between 40
and 50 years, between 50 and 60 years, and over 60 years). Then,
gender differences in ICT literacy were examined by including
gender and its interactions with age and socioeconomic status as
predictors of baseline and difference scores. These analyses were
specified as location-scale models (Rigby & Stasinopoulos, 2005)
with identity and log links for the mean and variance components,
respectively. This allowed exploring whether gender explained not
only mean ICT scores but also variance in ICT scores. In these
models, ICT scores were z-standardized with respect to the first
measurement. Therefore, the regression coefficients for the mean of
ICT scores can be interpreted similarly to traditional standardized
effect sizes in the normal metric. In contrast, the regression coefficients for the variance of ICT scores are reported in the logarithmic
metric. These analyses were repeated for each plausible value of
ICT literacy and then combined using Rubin’s rules to examine
latent effects corrected for measurement error (Mislevy, 1991).
The analyses adjusted for the varying time lag between the two
measurements by including the time lag as a covariate in the models.
Sampling weights were used to adjust for the disproportionate
sampling probabilities. Missing values were imputed 100 times with
classification and regression trees using chained equations (Doove
et al., 2014). However, the missing rates were rather low for all
variables (see Table 2). The analysis results of the multiple imputed
data sets were combined using Rubin’s rules. A Type I error level of
1% was assumed for all inference tests.
Ethics Statement
The study was conducted in full compliance with the ethical
standards outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and the requirements of the general data protection regulation in Germany. All data
collection procedures and instruments were approved by a special
data protection and security officer of the NEPS in line with national
ethical and legal regulations. All participants provided written
informed consent before study enrollment and could withdraw from
the longitudinal study at any time.
Results
Descriptive Analyses
ICT literacy scores were significantly (p < .01) negatively
associated with respondents’ age (see Table 2) on both measurement
occasions, r = −.47 and −.56, respectively, showing that it declined
with age. Mean-level analyses of within-person change over 9 years
mirrored this pattern, showing a small decrease in ICT literacy with
Cohen’s d = −0.30, 99% CI [−0.37, −0.23]. In addition, the
variance of ICT literacy decreased across measurement occasions by
a factor of 0.72, 99% CI [0.60, 0.84]; see standard deviations in
Table 2.
To illustrate the age-related trajectories in ICT literacy, Figure 1
plots the predicted effects of local polynomial regressions using
either ICT scores at the first measurement or the difference in ICT
scores between measurement occasions. The plot shows that the
age-related differences in ICT literacy between respondents
decreased almost linearly by about 2 SDs from respondents in their
twenties to those in their sixties. In contrast, the 9-year change
within persons showed no age-related variation. Rather, ICT literacy
declined comparably across all age groups.
Age-Related Change Trajectories
The latent change score model without moderating effects of
gender was identified by comparing a model with linear age effects
on the latent baseline and difference scores with a latent change
score model with piecewise age effects on both latent scores. Model
comparisons using the Bayesian information criterion favored the
simpler models with linear age over the more complex piecewise
models for baseline digital competence scores (Bayesian information criterion = 5,823 vs. 5,852) and difference scores between
measurements (Bayesian information criterion = 4,702 vs. 4,733).
These results were also confirmed by nonsignificant likelihood ratio
tests, F(8, 809.77) = 2.29, p = .020, and F(8, 266.20) = 0.96, p =
.468, which also favored the simpler models with linear age effects.

p < .01.
Therefore, a linear age trend was modeled in the subsequent
analyses.
On average, an age difference of 10 years corresponded to a
difference in baseline ICT literacy of about −0.49 SD, 99% CI
[−0.54, −0.43] (see Table 3); thus, ICT literacy declined continuously across age. In contrast, the decline in ICT literacy within
persons over 9 years was more or less stable across ages, changing
by only about −0.01 SD, 99% CI [−0.07, 0.09], over a 10-year
period. The variance in ICT scores at baseline appeared to gradually
decrease over 10 years by a factor of 0.95, 99% CI [0.90, 1.00].
However, the respective effect was not significant, p = .018. The
variance of the difference scores was not affected by the age of the
respondents, as indicated by the nonsignificant age effect, B =
−0.03, 99% CI [−0.04, 0.10] (see Table 3).

Gender Differences in ICT Literacy
The baseline model with linear age effects was extended to
include a main effect of gender and its interaction with age. As
summarized in Table 3, gender showed a main effect with men
having higher ICT literacy than women, B = −0.37, 99% CI [−0.60,
−0.13], but did not moderate age differences in baseline ICT scores.
This effect is also shown in Figure 2 (top row, left column), which
shows the predicted ICT scores for men and women. The plot shows
that, over the observed age range of the respondents, the difference
in ICT scores between gender remained almost constant, neither
increasing nor decreasing. In contrast, the difference in ICT scores
between the two measurements was not affected by gender, B =
0.07, 99% CI [−0.19, 0.33]. Thus, the 9-year change within persons
was comparable for men and women. Also, the variance in ICT
scores showed no gender differences (see Table 3).
Moderating Effects of Socioeconomic Status
The two indicators of socioeconomic status, that is, years in
education and occupational prestige, were evaluated in independent
analyses to examine the robustness of the results to the chosen
operationalization. The results summarized in Table 4 show that
socioeconomic status did not moderate gender differences in ICT
scores, either at baseline or for the 9-year difference score. However,
both indicators showed main effects, suggesting an additive effect.
Baseline digital competence scores increased by 0.24 standard units,
99% CI [0.17, 0.31], for each additional year of education and by
0.53 standard units, 99% CI [0.35, 0.71], for an increase of 1 SD in
occupational prestige. The respective main effects are visualized in
Figure 2 (top row) which shows the predicted ICT scores for respondents with 13 years of education (equivalent to a university
entrance qualification or vocational master’s degree) and 16 years of
education (equivalent to a bachelor’s degree). The chosen values of
years in education correspond approximately to the first and third
quartiles of the variable in the present sample. The plot shows that,
regardless of the age of the respondents, the ICT scores were
significantly higher for high status respondents compared to low
status respondents. A similar pattern emerged for occupational
prestige (see Table 4). Figure 2 (right plot) shows that the predicted
effects were significantly smaller for respondents with low prestige,
such as service or clerical workers, than for respondents with
high prestige, such as managers or professionals. Again, the chosen

Figure 2 (bottom row) also shows that the differences in ICT
scores between the two measurement occasions were moderated by
socioeconomic status. Respondents with more years in education or
higher prestige occupations exhibited a greater decline in ICT literacy than respondents with less education or lower prestige occupations, for whom the 9-year change was substantially smaller.

The variance in ICT scores was not robustly moderated by

between gender, socioeconomic status, and age of B = 0.04, 99% CI

Discussion
Although modern communication and information technologies
play an increasingly important role in daily work and private life for
many people, the question of how ICT literacy changes across the
lifespan and what disparities emerge during adulthood remains
underexplored. While research on the correlation between age and
ICT literacy has grown in recent years (e.g., Ertl et al., 2020; Olsson
et al., 2019; Van Laar et al., 2020), the present research is among the
first to adopt a longitudinal perspective to examine both performance differences between age groups and also within-person
changes. A particular focus of these investigations was on gender
disparities and how they evolve over the life course. A longitudinal
two-wave study of a large sample of German adults revealed four
key findings. First, younger individuals exhibited significantly
higher ICT literacy on average than older individuals. However, ICT
literacy declined gradually within all respondents, regardless of their
age. Second, gender differences in ICT literacy consistently favored
men and remained stable across age groups and over time. Third,
socioeconomic status did not moderate gender disparities in ICT
literacy. Finally, variance in ICT literacy was not systematically
linked to gender or socioeconomic status. These findings highlight
that while ICT literacy is subject to a systematic decline in adulthood, preexisting gender inequalities established during earlier
socialization processes persist across the life course.
Toward an Explanation of Adult ICT Literacy Declines
Interpreting within-person changes in ICT literacy over time is
inherently challenging as individual psychological processes are
often confounded with broader societal and technological developments that affect the population as a whole. Given the rapid pace
of technological change, technologies once considered cutting-edge
can quickly become obsolete, as seen in the widespread replacement
of, for example, optical media (e.g., CDs and DVDs) by cloud
storage and streaming services. Consequently, the observed decline
in ICT literacy could, in part, reflect a mismatch between the
assessment content and the prevalent technologies that were in use.
Although the administered tests focused on core applications such as
office software, email, and search engines (see Senkbeil et al., 2013)
that remained broadly relevant throughout the observation period,
other technologies such as real-time collaboration platforms gained
prominence (particularly, in the context of remote work during the
COVID-19 pandemic). Because such emerging tools were not
considered in the assessment, newer ICT competencies may not
have been adequately captured. In this case, the observed decline
may not reflect a true loss of digital skill, but rather a shift in the
types of skills being used. For example, participants may have
gained proficiency in newer tools while simultaneously losing
fluency in applications that became less central to their daily lives.
Moreover, the effect could have been amplified by differential

relevance of specific technologies across age groups, for example,
older adults relying more on traditional office software, while
younger individuals preferring messaging software and mobile
tools. Yet, the absence of age-related differences in longitudinal
decline suggests that such age-specific shifts are unlikely to fully
explain the observed pattern. Given that similar declines have been
reported in cross-sectional panel research involving adolescent
samples around the world (Fraillon et al., 2024), the findings may
point to a genuine decline in the specific ICT skills measured, even
as other, unmeasured digital competencies may have developed in
parallel.
From a psychological standpoint, the observed decline in ICT
literacy can be interpreted through, Baltes’ (1993) lifespan theory on
intelligence development. From this perspective, ICT literacy can be
understood as a domain-specific competence, a form of crystallized
intelligence, that, however, also relies on fluid cognitive skills
such as problem-solving and processing capacity (Senkbeil, 2022).
Consequently, its developmental trajectory is likely shaped by the
combined pattern of fluid and crystallized intelligence (Baltes,
1993). Fluid intelligence typically peaks in adolescence and begins
to gradually decline after approximately age 15, while crystallized
intelligence tends to increase slightly later and remains stable from
around age 20. Combining these trajectories suggests a steep growth
in ICT literacy until adolescence, followed by a plateau and a
gradual decline starting from around age 50. Although this idea
was originally proposed for reading and mathematical competencies (Lechner et al., 2021), it may also apply to ICT literacy.
While this theory can explain the observed decline in ICT
literacy—especially as the respondents in the present study were
on average 48 years at the first measurement which represents the
typical age the decline presumably onsets (Lechner, 2023)—it
would also predict age-related variations in growth, consistent with
our original hypothesis. However, contrary to this expectation, the
findings indicate a uniform decline in ICT literacy across all age
groups. Thus, current models of intelligence development (Baltes,
1993) only partially account for the observed patterns of change in
ICT development. These results suggest that further, still unknown,
processes need to be considered to fully capture the patterns of ICT
literacy development across adulthood.
Toward an Explanation of Gender Inequalities in ICT
Literacy
When interpreting findings on gender differences in ICT literacy,
it is essential to consider the age of the respondents, as the size and
direction of these differences appear to shift over time. Metaanalyses focusing on students revealed a female advantage in ICT
literacy (Campos & Scherer, 2024; Siddiq & Scherer, 2019) that was
more pronounced in primary schools compared to secondary
schools. In contrast, a meta-analysis that also included adult samples
identified small effects favoring boys and men (Qazi et al., 2022).
Similarly, longitudinal research has observed the emergence of a
gender gap favoring boys during late adolescents (Gnambs, 2021),
suggesting that gender disparities in ICT literacy may gradually
evolve over the life course. Given that several studies with adult
samples reported men to exhibit better digital skills than women
(Long et al., 2023; Martínez-Cantos, 2017; Van Laar et al., 2020),
we explored whether this trend continued in adulthood. We
hypothesized that ICT literacy would be higher for men than for
women, particularly as individuals grow older. However, our
findings did not support this assumption. While men consistently
demonstrated higher ICT literacy than women, the difference remained stable and did not grow with age or vary with baseline age or
socioeconomic status. These results confirm a persistent digital
divide in adulthood, favoring men.
Several explanations could account for the stability of gender
disparities in ICT literacy. First, despite some evidence to the
contrary (Bünning et al., 2023), ICT practices among men and
women might be more similar than different. Both genders frequently develop consistent habits and applications of ICT aligned
with their professional or personal needs. As modern workplaces
and daily life increasingly require similar uses of ICT, the observed
gap may neither narrow significantly nor widen further. Second,
many adults may reach a plateau in ICT literacy, achieving a level
sufficient to effectively use available digital devices. Without
pronounced deficits or active engagement in advanced training,
their skills may remain stagnant. This plateau effect could contribute to the stable gender gap observed. Third, gender differences
in ICT literacy often emerge during adolescence or earlier due to
societal norms, gender stereotypes, and differences in opportunities or
encouragement to engage with technology (see Gnambs, 2021). These
early influences tend to establish baseline differences in ICT skills that
may persist into adulthood unless new factors intervene.
Therefore, the observed stability of gender differences in ICT
literacy during adulthood might reflect the effect of stable ICT
usage patterns, comparable demands on ICT skills in everyday
contexts, and developmental processes already established during
adolescence.
Limitations and Future Research
Despite several notable strengths of the present study, including
the use of a large and diverse sample assessed in a repeated
measurement design, several limitations should be considered that
provide opportunities for future research. First, the study was
unable to isolate periodic effects, as this would require a cohortsequential design (Estrada & Ferrer, 2019). One such periodic
factor was the COVID-19 pandemic, which was ongoing during
the second measurement occasion. Given that the pandemic led to
an abrupt shift of workplaces and personal interactions into digital
spaces, an increase in computer and internet use seemed likely.
However, the present findings did not reveal a corresponding
improvement in ICT skills during the second wave. This highlights
an important factor: increased ICT usage does not automatically
translate into enhanced skill development, even though it provides
more learning opportunities. It is possible that the abrupt and
involuntary nature of the pandemic-driven digitization may have
worsened attitudes toward technology, thereby mitigating potential
improvements in ICT literacy. Future research should investigate the
development in ICT skills further to explore how contextual factors
influence skill acquisition.
Second, the conceptualization of ICT literacy in the present study
focused primarily on diverse technical and operational aspects of
using contemporary software and digital applications (Senkbeil
et al., 2013). Other critical dimensions of digital competence such as
the ability to critically evaluate online content, use social media
responsibly, or manage social interactions in digital environments
were not addressed. Yet, previous research indicates that gender

disparities may vary across these dimensions. For example, girls
have been found to outperform boys in areas related to communication and social networking, while boys tend to excel in tasks
requiring technical knowledge and information processing (Aesaert &
Van Braak, 2015; Christoph et al., 2015). Therefore, future research
is encouraged to consider additional facets of digital competence to
better capture the multifaceted nature of the concept (see Van Laar et
al., 2017; Vuorikari et al., 2022).
Finally, future studies should explore how factors such as inequalities in ICT access, motivation, stereotype beliefs, and anxiety
may contribute to the persistence of gender disparities (see Karpiński
et al., 2023). Integrating these concepts into a broader theoretical
context could help identify protective factors that may reduce genderspecific differences in ICT literacy and improve gender equality.
Moreover, incorporating behavioral measures such as frequency and
intensity of technology use (beyond simple indicators of access or
device ownership) may help uncovering mechanisms underlying the
observed decline in ICT literacy over time.
Conclusion
A substantial digital divide persists in the German population that
reflects both generational and gender-related inequalities. Notably,
ICT literacy showed a decline across all generations, despite the
rapid digitalization that was triggered by the recent pandemic. The
stable gender gap across age groups and the life course underscores
the importance of early socialization processes rooted in childhood
and adolescence for the development of digital skills. These findings
have profound implications, as digital competencies can exacerbate
inequalities in educational achievement, economic mobility as well
as social and civic participation, potentially widening existing social
divides. Consequently, targeted strategies are required to address
these disparities, particularly for ageing populations to catch up on
ICT skills that enable active and effective participation in a digital
society.
