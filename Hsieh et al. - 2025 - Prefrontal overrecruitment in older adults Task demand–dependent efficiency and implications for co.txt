This study examined how prefrontal overactivation in older adults relates to cognitive performance across
systematically varied task demands, testing predictions from major neural compensation theories. Using a
visual discrimination paradigm, we parametrically manipulated perceptual load, discrimination precision,
and response rule complexity. Participants included younger (N = 36; aged 19–33) and older adults (N = 36;
aged 56–82). Task performance was measured using inverse efficiency scores (IES), and functional
magnetic resonance imaging assessed brain activation. Older adults demonstrated disproportionately higher
IES, especially under the most complex condition, suggesting reduced efficiency with rising demand. fMRI
revealed widespread frontoparietal network activation differences, with older adults showing increased
recruitment of frontal regions compared with younger adults, especially at higher task demands. Critically,
prefrontal overactivation in older adults correlated negatively with performance at the highest demand level,
indicating capacity-limited compensation. Additionally, older adults exhibited reduced default mode
network suppression and diminished dorsal attention network recruitment, both of which were associated
with poorer task performance. These findings support the compensation-related utilization of neural circuits
hypothesis, which predicts a transition from adaptive to inefficient recruitment as cognitive demands
increase. They also align with broader frameworks such as the posterior–anterior shift in aging and the
revised scaffolding theory of aging and cognition, emphasizing the role of task complexity in shaping
compensatory patterns. Overall, the adaptiveness of neural overactivation in older adults appears to depend
on its relationship to both task demands and behavioral performance.
Public Significance Statement
This study showed that older adults recruit additional prefrontal regions to compensate for cognitive
decline, but this becomes ineffective under high task demands. Findings highlight the importance of
adjusting task difficulty to match individuals’ cognitive abilities at different ages, which can enhance the
accuracy of cognitive assessments and inform the design of age-friendly environments, such as
workplaces, homes, or public spaces.

PREFRONTAL OVERACTIVATION IN OLDER ADULTS
849
Cognitive aging is marked by a gradual decline across domains
such as memory, attention, and executive function, driven by
widespread neural changes (C. Grady, 2012; Park & Reuter-Lorenz,
2009). Structurally, aging disproportionately affects anterior brain
regions—particularly the prefrontal cortex (PFC)—which exhibit
more pronounced atrophy and connectivity loss than posterior areas
(Fjell et al., 2009; Raz et al., 2005). Although primary sensory
regions such as the occipital cortex remain relatively preserved
structurally (Raz & Rodrigue, 2006), older adults nonetheless
experience functional impairments in visual processing, including
diminished acuity and contrast sensitivity (Owsley, 2011). These
perceptual deficits are compounded by reduced efficiency in posterior cortical regions, particularly occipital and parietal areas
(Andersen, 2012), suggesting that sensory and executive changes in
aging are deeply interconnected (Monge & Madden, 2016).
One robust pattern in functional neuroimaging is that older adults
show increased activation in frontal regions relative to younger adults
during cognitively demanding tasks—a phenomenon often described
as frontal overactivation (Cabeza et al., 2018). A key theoretical
explanation for this pattern is the compensation-related utilization of
neural circuits hypothesis (CRUNCH), which posits that older adults
recruit additional neural resources to offset reduced processing
capacity (Reuter-Lorenz & Cappell, 2008). Critically, CRUNCH
proposes a nonlinear trajectory of neural recruitment: frontal overactivation may support performance under moderate demands, but as
task complexity increases, compensatory capacity is eventually
exceeded, leading to underrecruitment and impaired performance
(Morcom & Henson, 2018; Schneider-Garces et al., 2010).
This compensatory trajectory also aligns with the posterior–
anterior shift in aging (PASA) model, which describes a functional
reorganization from posterior to anterior regions during cognitive
tasks (Davis et al., 2008). According to the PASA model, increased
prefrontal activation in older adults relative to younger adults may
reflect a shift away from declining sensory regions toward relatively
preserved control systems—a pattern that reflects both anatomical
vulnerability and strategic compensation. To provide a broader lifespan
perspective, the scaffolding theory of aging and cognition (STAC), and
its revised version (STAC-r), conceptualize frontal overactivation as
dynamic compensatory scaffolding in response to structural decline in
older adults relative to younger adults (Park & Reuter-Lorenz, 2009;
Reuter-Lorenz & Park, 2014). STAC-r integrates the effects of lifecourse enrichment factors (e.g., education, physical activity, cognitive
engagement) that help maintain or bolster compensatory capacity.
Thus, variability in older adults’ neural responses is shaped by both
current neural integrity and cumulative experiential factors.
Cabeza et al.’s (2018) unify these perspectives in a comprehensive framework that evaluates overactivation in terms of its
functional relevance. They emphasize that increased activation in
older adults, relative to younger adults, should not be assumed to
reflect compensation unless it demonstrably supports task performance.
Overactivation may instead reflect dedifferentiation or inefficiency if
it fails to yield behavioral benefits, or if it emerges in nontask-relevant
regions. This distinction is critical for accurately characterizing the
mechanisms underlying age-related changes in neural recruitment.
Although overactivation is well established, its functional significance remains contested. Some studies associate increased frontal
recruitment with maintained or enhanced performance, consistent
with successful compensation (Cabeza et al., 2018; Park & ReuterLorenz, 2009). Others, however, find that overactivation may reflect
inefficient or unsuccessful compensation, particularly when it does
not yield behavioral benefits—or is even negatively correlated with
performance (Dennis & Cabeza, 2011; Morcom & Henson, 2018).
These contrasting findings highlight a critical need to distinguish
between successful compensation, in which increased activation
supports performance, and attempted but ineffective compensation,
where neural effort fails to yield benefits (Cabeza et al., 2018). This
interpretive distinction is central to Cabeza et al.’s (2018) framework, which argues that only activation that contributes to task
success should be labeled compensatory. They further suggest
evaluating the relationship between activation and performance at
the individual level to determine whether neural engagement reflects
adaptive or maladaptive responses to cognitive challenge.
To address this open question, the present study employed a visual
discrimination paradigm adapted from Crittenden and Duncan
(2014), designed to parametrically vary task difficulty along three
orthogonal dimensions: perceptual load, discrimination precision,
and response rule complexity. This design allows for a fine-grained
analysis of how brain–behavior relationships evolve across escalating
task demands, offering a direct test of key predictions from
CRUNCH, PASA, and STAC-r. Unlike prior studies comparing age
groups at a single task level, our parametric approach enables
identification of the point at which compensatory mechanisms begin
to fail. By situating our predictions within Cabeza et al.’s (2018)
framework, we aim to distinguish between beneficial compensation
and maladaptive overactivation by examining whether age-related
activation patterns are positively or negatively associated with
behavioral performance at each level of task demand.
We hypothesize that older adults will show greater prefrontal
activation than younger adults across all conditions, consistent with
compensatory recruitment. Under low or moderate task demands, this
overactivation is expected to be positively associated with performance, reflecting successful compensation. At the highest demand
levels, however, we anticipate a dissociation between activation and
performance: either overactivation will become ineffective, or underrecruitment will emerge due to capacity limitations—patterns
predicted by the upper-bound limits in the CRUNCH model.
According to Cabeza et al. (2018), such a shift in the activation–
performance relationship may signify a transition from successful to
unsuccessful compensation, offering critical evidence for evaluating
the functional nature of overactivation in aging.

In addition, we examine whether older adults’ task-related activations spatially overlap with brain regions associated with largescale intrinsic networks implicated in cognitive aging. Prior work
suggests that aging may involve reduced suppression or altered
modulation of the default mode network (DMN) during externally
oriented tasks, potentially undermining attentional focus (C. L. Grady
et al., 2010; Spreng et al., 2016). Accordingly, we hypothesize that
older adults, relative to younger adults, will show greater overlap with
DMN regions—particularly under high-demand conditions—and
that this overlap may be negatively associated with behavioral performance. Conversely, reduced overlap with the dorsal attention
network (DAN) may reflect age-related difficulties in sustaining goaldirected attention during demanding tasks. These network-level shifts
may further illustrate how compensatory or maladaptive responses
are implemented in aging, complementing regional analyses and
supporting Cabeza et al.’s (2018) argument for evaluating compensation at multiple spatial scales.
In sum, this study provided a multilevel investigation of agerelated neural compensation, examining both regional activation
patterns and network-level spatial dynamics across a continuous
gradient of cognitive demands. By integrating CRUNCH, PASA,
and STAC-r into a unified empirical framework, we aim to delineate
the boundary conditions under which compensatory activation in
older adults is beneficial—and when it fails. Our inclusion of Cabeza
et al.’s (2018) criteria for evaluating compensation strengthens this
framework by explicitly testing whether overactivation enhances
performance or reflects dedifferentiation, providing a more nuanced
understanding of cognitive aging mechanisms.

Participants
All participants were recruited through online advertisements and
bulletin boards at the university and in the local community. The data
collection period spanned from November 2023 to December 2024. A
power analysis was conducted using G*Power 3.1.9.7 (Faul et al.,
2007), with parameters set for a power of 0.95, effect size f = 0.25,
α = .05, and a within-between subjects design, assuming a correlation
of 0.5 among repeated measures. Participants were screened through
self-reporting to ensure the absence of neurological or psychiatric
disorders. In addition, the cognitive status of older adults was assessed
using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al.,
2005), with a cutoff score of 26. Those participants with an average
accuracy below 50% in the behavioral task were excluded from
further analysis. The study was approved by the Human Research
Ethics Committee of National Cheng Kung University (Approval No.
NCKU HREC-E-112-120-2). Following completion of the study,
which included computerized working memory tasks (conducted
outside the magnetic resonance imaging scanner) and a visual
discrimination task performed within the magnetic resonance imaging
scanner, participants were compensated with approximately U.S.$50
for their participation.
Stimuli, Tasks, Responses, and Procedure
Visual Discrimination Tasks With Varying Levels of
Task Demand
The experiment involved participants performing a visual discrimination task with four different conditions, as shown in Figure 1.
The task was developed using OpenSesame (Mathôt et al., 2012).
During scanning, the stimulus was projected onto a mirror mounted
on the head coil. The task design was adapted from cognitive load
manipulations described by Crittenden and Duncan (2014), involving
a range of tasks from simple perceptual discrimination to more
complex rule-based tasks.
In each trial, the baseline condition (4L) began with a uniform gray
screen. Participants were tasked with identifying the one line that
differed in length from three others, making this the least demanding
condition requiring simple perceptual discrimination. Each trial
started with a fixation cross at the screen’s center for 200 ms. Then,
four vertical lines appeared for 100 ms, symmetrically aligned around
the fixation cross, with the total width subtending 8.3° of visual angle.
Three of the lines were identical in length (13.4°), and the fourth was
50% shorter (6.7°). Participants identified the shorter line’s position
using an 8-button response box, and responses were recorded within a
1,000 ms window after the disappearance of the lines. A jittered
interstimulus interval of 500 to 1,500 ms followed each trial.
The remaining conditions varied slightly, as described below. In
the 8L condition, eight lines were displayed instead of four, with two
additional lines placed on either side of the original set (total display
width 16.7°). Participants were required to use both hands, specifically the little and ring fingers, to respond. This condition increased
the perceptual load, making the task more cognitively demanding
than the 4L condition.
In the fine discrimination (FD) condition, participants still viewed
four lines, but the shortest line was only 10% shorter than the others.
This required more subtle perceptual judgments, significantly
raising cognitive demands due to the need for precise discrimination
between nearly identical line lengths.
The mapping switch (MS) condition involved an alteration of the
stimulus–response mapping as shown in Figure 1. While participants still needed to discriminate between lines of similar lengths,
the response required a shift in the usual button mapping, with the
right-most odd line corresponding to the left-most button. This
introduced more complex cognitive processing, including working
memory and response inhibition, making this the most demanding
condition, as it placed significant strain on executive functions
(Duncan, 2010; Duncan & Owen, 2000). Participants practiced this
condition until achieving at least 70% accuracy.
Each trial type was grouped into blocks, with each block corresponding to a single condition. A schematic of the upcoming
condition was displayed in the center of the screen for 2000 ms at the
start of each block. Following a 3,800 ms pause, the first trial of the
block began. Each block contained 8 trials, lasting a total of 18.4 s. A
10-s break occurred between blocks. To encourage engagement,
participants were shown the accuracy of each block at its conclusion.

Note. This figure illustrates the response rules for the four task conditions. In each condition,
participants identified the position of the shortest line using either four response buttons (for the 4L,
FD, and MS conditions) or eight response buttons (for the 8L condition). Icons beneath each example
indicate the correct response for that trial. The task conditions were as follows: (A) 4-line (4L)
condition: participants selected the shortest line from four options. (B) 8-line (8L) condition: participants selected the shortest line from eight options. (C) Fine discrimination (FD) condition: participants identified the shortest line from four options with minimal size differences. (D) Mapping switch
(MS) condition: participants selected the shortest line from four options with reversed stimulus–
response mapping. Arrows indicate the correct key press for each position of the shortest line. See the
online article for the color version of this figure.
The experiment consisted of three scanning sessions, each separated by a 30-s break. Each session included 25 task blocks, five for
each of the five conditions. The order of blocks within each session
was pseudorandomly arranged.
The final reaction time (RT) and accuracy will be used to calculate
the inverse efficiency score (IES; Bruyer & Brysbaert, 2011; Townsend
& Ashby, 1978, 1983), which serves as a corrected behavioral measure
that integrates both speed and accuracy (see Equation 1).

Design and Statistical Analysis
Behavioral Data: Task Performance Analysis Between the
Two Age Groups
Behavioral performance measures—including RT, accuracy, and
IES—were analyzed separately for each of the four conditions
(4L, 8L, FD, MS) and for both age groups (younger and older
adults). Subsequently, we performed mixed-design repeated-measures analyses of variances with a 2 (age group: younger vs. older) ×
4 (condition: 4L, 8L, FD, MS) design on each task performance
measure. Post hoc comparisons were then conducted using the Holm
correction to further explore and compare significant differences
between conditions. Importantly, in the main text, we reported only
the IES results, as this metric integrates both RT and accuracy,
accounting for potential performance trade-offs between the two
groups.
Neuroimaging Data: fMRI Imaging Acquisition and

scanner was fitted with a 32-channel receive-only phased-array head
coil. High-resolution structural scans were acquired with a fast
spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence. The imaging parameters
were repetition time = 7.6 ms, echo time = 3.3 ms, flip angle = 12°;
field of view = 22.4 × 22.4 cm2; matrix size = 224 × 224; slice
thickness = 1. Functional echo planar imaging images were captured using an interleaved T2* weighted gradient-echo planar
imaging pulse sequence (repetition time/echo time/flip angle: 2000
ms/30 ms/78°; matrix size: 64 × 64; field of view: 22 × 22 cm2; slice
thickness: 3 mm; voxel size: 3.4375 × 3.4375 × 3 mm). Each session
included 368 volumes, with the first eight volumes discarded as
dummy scans to account for T1 equilibrium effects.
fMRI Imaging Preprocessing
The preprocessing of functional imaging data was carried out using
the FMRIB Software Library (FSL; FMRIB stands for the Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library;
Jenkinson et al., 2012). The process began with motion artifact
correction through the Motion Correction FMRIB’s Linear Image
Registration Tool (MCFLIRT; Beckmann et al., 2003; Jenkinson &
Smith, 2001; Jenkinson et al., 2002). Following this, nonbrain tissue
was removed from the MR images using the Brain Extraction Tool
(Jenkinson et al., 2002). To identify outlier volumes, the FSL Motion
Outliers tool (Jenkinson & Smith, 2001; Jenkinson et al., 2002) was
applied, with outliers defined as those exceeding the 75th percentile
plus 1.5 times the interquartile range of frame displacement between
volumes. These outliers were excluded from further analysis to
minimize their impact. Each participant’s brain functional images
were registered to their high-resolution T1 structural images via linear
transformation, followed by the registration of the individual structural images to the MNI152 template. A first-level general linear
model (GLM) analysis was performed using FSL’s FMRI Expert
Analysis Tool (Woolrich et al., 2001, 2004), incorporating spatial
smoothing with a 9 mm full-width half-maximum Gaussian kernel.
Statistical Analysis: Block Design fMRI Analysis
For every participant, a GLM was employed to estimate differences across experimental conditions in the visual discrimination
task. Contrasts were conducted to identify regions that showed
greater activation in the 8L, FD, and MS conditions compared with
the 4L condition. The onset of each condition block was defined
from the start of the stimulus to the end of the block, and this
was used to create the onset files. These files for each of the four
conditions were included as explanatory variables in the GLM and
were convolved with a double γ hemodynamic response function.
The six head motion parameters, along with the motion outlier data
from earlier steps, were incorporated as covariates to control for
potential confounds.
Statistical Analysis of Condition-Related Effects
The data from the three runs will be averaged and entered into a
group-level analysis to identify significant clusters for the three
contrasts (8L–4L, FD–4L, MS–4L) in both the younger and older
adult groups. Significant clusters of activity were identified using a
cluster-level threshold of 0.05 and a z threshold of 3.1 for defining
contiguous clusters (Eklund et al., 2016). The significance of each
cluster, based on Gaussian random field theory, was compared with
the probability threshold (Bansal et al., 2007). Sex and years of
education were included as covariates in the design matrix by specifying them in the explanatory variables (EVs) section of the model
setup. Each covariate was mean-centered and added as an additional
column in the design matrix. This allowed their effects to be modeled
and regressed out from the group-level statistical analysis, thereby
controlling for their potential confounding influence on the results.
Statistical Analyses Examining Age-Related
Effects and the Association Between Brain Activation and
Behavioral Performance
To examine age-related differences in brain activity, three condition contrasts of interest were computed: 8L–4L, FD–4L, and MS–
4L were conducted separately for each participant. The resulting
contrast images (COPEs) from the younger and older adult groups
were then entered into a group-level analysis using FSL FMRI
Expert Analysis Tool. A two-group unpaired t test was performed to
compare the two age groups. Contrasts were defined to identify brain
regions showing greater activation in older compared with younger
adults (O > Y), as well as regions showing greater activation in
younger compared with older adults (Y > O). For each significant
cluster identified in both contrasts, spherical regions of interest
(ROIs) with a 3 mm radius were created around the peak voxel
coordinates provided by FSL. Within each ROI, the mean z values
were extracted for each participant. These values were then used to
investigate the relationship between brain activation and behavioral
performance. Specifically, scatterplots were generated to examine
the association between mean z values and IES scores. In each plot,
data from the younger and older adult groups were displayed
separately within the same figure, allowing for a visual comparison
of brain–behavior relationships across age groups.
Results
Participants
A total of 80 participants were contacted and recruited. Among
these, two participants could not complete the experiment due
to equipment failure, and another two were excluded from the
magnetic resonance imaging experiment as they were unable to
understand and complete the training and practice phases of the
behavioral experiment. Additionally, four participants were excluded
from the analysis due to an average accuracy of less than 0.5 in the
behavioral experiment, raising concerns about random responses.
Ultimately, 36 younger participants (19 males, 17 females) and 36
older participants (16 males, 20 females) were included in the final
analysis. The younger participants had a mean age of 23.8 years
(range = 19–33 years, SD = 3.34) and a mean of 16.11 years of
education (range = 13–20 years, SD = 1.49). The older participants
had a mean age of 67.1 years (range = 56–82 years, SD = 5.37) and a
mean of 14.58 years of education (range = 9–20 years, SD = 2.48).
All older adults scored in the normal range on the MoCA, a screening
tool for mild cognitive impairment. The mean MoCA score for the
older group was 28.61 (SD = 1.46, out of 30; see Table 1). This
confirms that our older participants were cognitively healthy older
adults without evidence of significant impairment. Refer to Table 1

Behavioral Data for the Visual Discrimination
Task for Two Age Groups
Figure 2 presents the IES scores for the four conditions across the
two age groups. A 2 × 4 mixed-design repeated-measures analyses of
variance revealed a significant main effect of condition, F(3, 210) =
45.68, p < .001, η2 p = 0.40. Post hoc tests, adjusted using the Holm
2 p
correction for multiple comparisons, identified specific differences
among the conditions. The 4L condition significantly differed from
the MS condition, t(71) = −10.66, p < .001, Cohen’s d = −1.68, the
8L condition also significantly differed from the MS condition, t(71)
= −8.72, p < .001, Cohen’s d = −1.37, and the FD condition also
significantly differed from the MS condition, t(71) = −8.78, p < .001,
Cohen’s d = −1.38.
Additionally, a significant main effect of age group was observed,
F(1, 70) = 49.09, p < .001, η2 p = 0.41. The interaction effect between
age group and conditions was also significant, F(3, 210) = 21.62, p <
.001, η2 p = 0.24, indicating that the relationship between group and
condition varied significantly across the four conditions. Further
analysis showed that age group differences were significant across all
four conditions: 4L condition, F(1, 70) = 86.39, p < .001, Cohen’s d =
2.19; 8L condition, F(1, 70) = 63.29, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.88; FD
condition, F(1, 70) = 34.18, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.38; and MS
condition, F(1, 70) = 29.56, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 1.28.

MS–4L, comparing these conditions across all younger participants.
The contrast images, shown in Figure 3, were evaluated with a
threshold of p < .01 and a 3.1 z threshold to define contiguous
clusters (Eklund et al., 2016). Detailed cluster information can be
found in Supplemental Table S1 which includes comprehensive
statistical parameters, such as Z values, voxel coordinates, and
cluster sizes for all contrasts (8L–4L, FD–4L, MS–4L).
Each of the contrasts (see Supplemental Table S1) revealed
widespread activation throughout the frontoparietal cortex. Parietal
activations for the 8L condition were more extensive and somewhat
more anterior than those seen in the FD and MS conditions across
both hemispheres. Activation was observed bilaterally in areas
surrounding the intraparietal sulcus, including the inferior parietal
and angular gyrus regions. On the medial surface of the PFC, near
the middle cingulum, all three contrasts displayed significant
activity, with the most extensive activation for MS and the most
localized for 8L. Additionally, the peak activation in the medial PFC
for the 8L condition was located more caudally compared with FD
and MS.
Joint activation across all three contrasts was observed bilaterally
in the anterior insula/frontal operculum, with the most restricted
activation for the 8L–4L contrast. Notably, distinct activation patterns
were found in the lateral frontal lobe. For the 8L–4L contrast, significant activation in the left frontal lobe was concentrated around the
precentral gyrus, with another notable cluster in the middle frontal
region (−31, 36, 27). For the FD–4L contrast, activation appeared
near the frontal operculum and insula (32, 24, −8). The MS–4L
contrast showed widespread activation from the frontal pole, extending along the ventral margin of the frontal lobe to the inferior and
middle frontal regions.
In the right frontal lobe, the clusters under the 8L–4L contrast
were primarily located around the precentral gyrus, with a larger
activation cluster near the middle frontal region (36, 38, 19)
compared with the left side. Interestingly, the pattern for the MS–4L
contrast in the right frontal lobe mirrored that seen on the left side.
Moreover, the significant clusters in the right frontal lobe for the

Whole-Brain Univariate Analysis of Paired-Contrast
Results for the Older Group
Similar to the younger group, we present the three contrasts of the
older group in Figure 4. Detailed cluster information can be found in
Supplemental Table S2 which includes comprehensive statistical
parameters, such as Z values, voxel coordinates, and cluster sizes for
all contrasts (8L–4L, FD–4L, MS–4L). Notably, compared with the
younger group, the older group shows larger clusters in the inferior
temporal and temporal pole regions for the 8L–4L contrast.
Additionally, the cluster in the occipital region expands, and the
frontal region extends anteriorly to include the inferior frontal and
frontal pole areas.
In the FD–4L contrast, the older group shows an expansion of the
cluster in the occipital region toward the posterior direction, while
the frontal region expands toward the middle frontal area.
Additionally, it is noteworthy that the older group has more
clusters exceeding the threshold on the left side compared with the
younger group (see Figure 4), resulting in more symmetrical activation areas between the left and right hemispheres.
In the MS–4L contrast, the differences between the younger
group and the older group are relatively small. However, the
activation cluster in the frontal region is less localized in the older
group, forming a more continuous area.

(Older > Younger and Younger > Older Contrasts)
Whole-brain two-sample contrasts revealed age effects in both
directions (i.e., older > younger and younger > older; see Figure 5A
and 5B and Supplemental Table S3). Older adults showed greater
activation than younger adults in prefrontal and anterior midline
regions (older > younger; see Figure 5A and Supplemental Table
S3), whereas younger adults exhibited higher activation in bilateral
superior parietal cortex and occipital visual areas (younger > older;
see Figure 5B and Supplemental Table S3). This pattern—reduced
engagement of posterior attention and visual regions by older adults
alongside increased frontal activation—is consistent with an age

related posterior-to-anterior shift (i.e., PASA) in neural recruitment.
Furthermore, preliminary observations suggested that older adults
exhibited reduced task-induced deactivation in DMN regions, along
with weaker recruitment of DAN areas, relative to younger adults.
These neural differences, particularly under high task demand, and
their associations with performance are described in detail in
subsequent sections.
To further investigate the functional significance of the agerelated differences in activation, we extracted the mean z values
from the significant clusters identified in both the older > younger
and younger > older contrasts for each condition (8L–4L, FD–4L,
MS–4L; see Figure 5 and Supplemental Table S3). We then correlated these extracted activation values with individual IESs within
each age group (Supplemental Figures S1–S2 and Tables S4–S6).
For regions identified in the older > younger contrast, activation–
performance relationships in older adults generally did not reach
significance, indicating a lack of reliable association with task
performance. In contrast, for regions where younger adults showed
greater activation than older adults (younger > older contrast), a
task-dependent relationship between activation and performance in
older adults emerged. Specifically, under the highest task demand
condition (MS–4L contrast), significant positive correlations were
observed in anterior regions, including the frontal pole and orbitofrontal cortex, indicating that higher activation in these areas was
reliably linked to less efficient performance (i.e., higher IES).
Overall, these findings suggest that age-related overactivation
exhibits region-specific rather than uniform associations with
behavior. In older adults, certain lateral frontal clusters showed
increased activation coupled with poorer performance under high
task demands; however, this pattern did not extend to other regions.
To transparently illustrate these differential brain–behavior relationships, individual subject-level scatterplots are provided in the
Supplemental Figures S1–S2 and Tables S4–S6, along with
regression diagnostics and age-group contrasts.
Task-Related Deactivation Versus Activation
Older adults demonstrated a reduction in task-induced deactivation
within the DMN. During task performance, older adults exhibited
higher activation in DMN regions (e.g., medial frontal cortex, posterior cingulate) compared with younger adults, who showed the
typical below-baseline deactivation in these areas. Conversely,
younger adults more strongly engaged the DAN than older adults. For
instance, task-related activation in the intraparietal sulcus and frontal
eye fields was greater in younger adults, indicating age-related underrecruitment of attentional networks in older adults. These patterns
are illustrated in Supplemental Figures S3–S4.
Crucially, older adults also exhibited significant differences
in task-induced DMN deactivation relative to younger adults.
Specifically, older adults showed significantly less deactivation—or
even positive activation—in canonical DMN regions, including the
medial PFC and posterior cingulate cortex (p < .001; see Figure 5A
and Supplemental Table S3). Younger adults, in contrast, displayed
robust DMN deactivation during task engagement, which was
associated with more efficient performance. Together, these findings
suggest that older adults experience difficulty suppressing the DMN
and concurrently exhibit weaker activation of task-relevant attentional networks, potentially contributing to their performance
deficits.
In contrast to the DMN, regions within the DAN—which closely
overlapped with the younger > older activation clusters identified in
our analysis (see Figure 5B and Supplemental Figure S4)—exhibited
a distinct behavioral association in the older group. Specifically,
under the highest task demand condition (MS–4L contrast), we
observed a significant negative correlation between DAN activation
and performance among older adults (see Figure 5C). That is, higher
activation in canonical DAN regions such as the intraparietal sulcus
and frontal eye fields was associated with poorer behavioral outcomes in the older cohort. It is possible that, when challenged by the
MS–4L condition, older adults attempt to recruit the DAN but do
so in a less targeted or more diffuse manner, resulting in overengagement that fails to translate into performance benefits.
Discussion
The present study systematically examined prefrontal overactivation across varying cognitive demands using a visual discrimination task, providing clear support for the CRUNCH model
(Reuter-Lorenz & Cappell, 2008; Schneider-Garces et al., 2010).
Older adults consistently showed greater brain activation than
younger adults across all cognitive load conditions, with the largest
difference observed under the highest demand (MS–4L). Notably, the
observed age-related brain overactivation exhibits region-specific
rather than uniform associations with behavior. In older adults, brain
regions where younger adults showed greater activation—primarily
in more lateral portions of the frontal pole—exhibited a significant
negative correlation between activation and performance, indicating
that higher activation in these areas was linked to poorer efficiency.
This relationship, however, did not extend to other regions.
Conversely, younger adults showed greater activation in posterior
attentional and visual processing regions (e.g., superior parietal
cortex, occipital areas), highlighting a posterior-to-anterior shift
with aging, consistent with the PASA model (Davis et al., 2008).
These findings emphasize a clear dissociation: older adults’ additional frontal recruitment occurs alongside reduced posterior
engagement, particularly under conditions of maximal cognitive
demand. This pattern is consistent with Cabeza et al. (2018), who
argue that aging-related overactivation can reflect both compensatory engagement and dedifferentiation, depending on the task
demands and whether the recruitment benefits performance. Our
findings reveal a regionally differentiated pattern within the PFC.
Across most prefrontal regions, increased activation in older adults
did not reliably predict performance outcomes. However, significant
negative correlations emerged in the lateral frontal pole—regions
where younger adults typically showed greater engagement—
indicating that higher activation was associated with poorer efficiency in older adults. This supports the notion that overactivation
may reflect unsuccessful compensation in specific subregions, reinforcing the idea that prefrontal engagement in aging is functionally
heterogeneous.
Behavioral performance results provided a clear and interpretable
foundation for our neuroimaging findings. As expected, both
younger and older adults showed increasing task difficulty reflected
in worsening IES across the task continuum. However, older adults
demonstrated slower reaction times and reduced accuracy across all
conditions, resulting in significantly higher IES. These differences
were especially pronounced in the MS–4L condition, which combined complex stimulus discrimination with unpredictable response

mappings. The disproportionate increase in IES for older adults in
this condition reflects a nonlinear decline in cognitive efficiency
with increasing task complexity, consistent with prior research
on age-related deficits in executive control, task switching, and
interference resolution (Braver & West, 2008; Verhaeghen &
Cerella, 2002). Importantly, this behavioral pattern aligns with the
CRUNCH, which predicts that older adults experience increasing
difficulty as task demands approach or exceed their compensatory
limits. The steep performance decline under MS–4L thus provides
behavioral evidence of cognitive overload, supporting our neural
findings that frontal overactivation at this level is no longer effective
but maladaptive. The relative parity in performance between age
groups under low and moderate task demands suggests that compensatory mechanisms may initially preserve behavioral efficiency
in older adults, but ultimately fail when demand exceeds neural
capacity. This echoes the load-dependent collapse proposed by both
CRUNCH and STAC-r (Mattay et al., 2006; Park & Reuter-Lorenz,
2009; Schneider-Garces et al., 2010). Cabeza et al. (2018) suggested
that compensatory responses in aging are most effective when there
is still sufficient neural reserve and connectivity to support taskrelevant processing. Our behavioral findings, especially under MS–
4L, are consistent with this notion: older adults’ compensatory
responses may become ineffective or even detrimental when the
cognitive system is pushed beyond its adaptable limits.
Critically, our neuroimaging results (Figure 5) reinforce this
interpretation. Frontal overactivation under the MS–4L condition
was functionally heterogeneous—particularly in lateral regions
where younger adults showed greater activation than older adults
(Y > O)—and these regions exhibited significant negative correlations with performance, suggesting unsuccessful or inefficient
compensation (Dennis & Cabeza, 2011). By employing parametric
task manipulations, our study extended previous binary-load
CRUNCH paradigms, illustrating a gradual erosion of compensatory efficacy (Morcom & Henson, 2018). Cabeza et al. (2018)
emphasized evaluating the relationship between activation and
performance to distinguish compensation from maladaptive recruitment. Our use of IES helps clarify this distinction—overactivation in
the absence of behavioral benefit should not be interpreted as
compensatory.
Frontal regions exhibited a clear quantitative difference: specifically, lateral frontal clusters—where younger adults typically outperform older adults—showed significant negative correlations with
IES in older adults, suggesting maladaptive overactivation under high
demand (MS–4L). While theories such as STAC-r (Reuter-Lorenz &
Park, 2014) and hierarchical models (Badre & Nee, 2018) propose
that certain anterior PFC subregions may offer transient compensatory support, our data do not reveal a clear adaptive role for these
regions under high cognitive load. The absence of significant positive
activation–performance correlations suggests that, when demands
exceed capacity, these areas may fail to support performance. These
frameworks emphasize that compensation is region-specific, depending on structural integrity, connectivity, and functional specialization (Cabeza et al., 2018; Morcom & Henson, 2018). Our
findings align with this view: while some lateral frontal regions show
maladaptive recruitment, other anterior areas exhibit no significant
relationship with performance—highlighting functional heterogeneity within the PFC. Overall, our results support the view that frontal
engagement in aging reflects region-specific limitations rather than a
uniform compensatory process. Cabeza et al. (2018) similarly argued
that compensation varies with task demands and regional specialization. Our results provide empirical support for this position,
showing task- and region-specific distinctions in the utility of frontal
overactivation. These results align with evidence that age-related
structural atrophy and functional inefficiency are not uniformly
distributed across the cortex (Fjell et al., 2009), and suggest that the
success or failure of compensatory engagement may depend on both
regional capacity and task context (Spreng & Turner, 2019). Our
findings therefore underscore the value of parametric task designs for
tracing dynamic changes in the effectiveness of compensatory
activation in aging.
Older adults also exhibited altered activation patterns in large-scale
networks. Specifically, reduced DMN suppression under high load
suggests impaired inhibition of task-irrelevant processes (C. L. Grady
et al., 2010; Spreng et al., 2016). While this may reflect general
deactivation deficits, it could also indicate inefficient switching
between internal and external modes, a hallmark of cognitive aging.
Similarly, altered DAN engagement may reflect changes in top-down
attentional control. However, given our reliance on spatial overlap
rather than connectivity, these interpretations remain tentative. Future
work using connectivity and graph-theoretical approaches is needed
to clarify these network-level changes.
While our findings emphasize task demand in shaping neural
recruitment in aging, the observed effects may be domain-specific.
Our task engaged frontoparietal networks involved in executive
function and perceptual decisions (Crittenden & Duncan, 2014).
Other domains (e.g., episodic memory) engage distinct circuits with
potentially different compensation profiles (Yassa et al., 2011).
STAC suggests that compensation occurs across domains, but with
varying neural substrates and efficacy. Cross-domain studies using
comparable paradigms are needed to determine whether CRUNCH
and STAC-r principles are generalizable. Our domain-specific results nevertheless support the broader claim of Cabeza et al. (2018):
compensation and dedifferentiation can co-occur, varying in
adaptiveness depending on the circuits and demands involved.
Several limitations warrant consideration. First, reliance on IES
may obscure specific mechanisms due to sensitivity to error rates and
speed–accuracy trade-offs (Bruyer & Brysbaert, 2011). Although
error rates were modest (<10% in most conditions), they exceeded
15% in MS–4L for older adults. Still, supplementary analyses
confirmed that the age-related patterns were robust. Second, lack of a
fixation baseline limits our inferences about DMN suppression.
Future work should include rest conditions to isolate task-negative
activity. Third, unmeasured factors like cognitive reserve and lifestyle
may influence compensation (Cabeza et al., 2018; Stern, 2002).
Finally, longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these
brain–behavior shifts predict cognitive decline or resilience.
Conclusion
This study provided strong evidence for a graded, capacitylimited model of neural compensation in aging, consistent with the
CRUNCH and STAC-r frameworks. Frontal overactivation was
initially associated with adaptive responses but became maladaptive
under high demand (MS–4L), suggesting limits to compensatory
mechanisms. These findings extend prior research by demonstrating
gradual declines in compensation shaped by task complexity and
regional specialization.

Our results support Cabeza et al.’s (2018) integrative framework,
showing that compensation, dedifferentiation, and inefficiency coexist
and vary with context and activation–performance dynamics. They
also align with the PASA and STAC-r models, highlighting a
dynamic interplay between posterior underrecruitment and anterior
overrecruitment as a function of task demands and regional neural
capacity.
Practically, the findings suggest that tracking the trajectory of IESs
across escalating task demands (from 4L to 8L to FD to MS) could
offer a sensitive behavioral indicator of cognitive vulnerability in
older adults. A steeper IES slope—reflecting a sharper efficiency drop
under increasing cognitive load—may help identify individuals at
greater risk for age-related decline. These insights underscore the
value of adjusting task complexity to better align with individuals’
cognitive capacity at different ages, not only in cognitive assessments
but also in the design of training environments, workplace demands,
and everyday public settings. Tailored cognitive training paradigms
that scaffold task demands and foster more efficient recruitment of
cognitive resources could support cognitive health and enhance agefriendliness in diverse applied contexts.
