Neuroimaging studies have shown that aging alters the brain mechanisms underlying attentional
control, even when behavioral performance is equivalent between younger and older adults. Instead of
attributing these changes to compensatory mechanisms, we investigated whether age-related neuromodulatory changes in the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system are underlying these effects.
To test whether aging leads to LC-NA system hyperactivity, we combined two methodological approaches: an oculomotor visual search task to assess eye movements and the threat of unpredictable
electric shock paradigm to induce sustained arousal. Using pupillometry, we found that arousal reduced
evoked pupil responses in both age groups, demonstrating the expected pattern of lower phasic
noradrenergic activity under arousal. Young adults made significantly more first fixations to the
physically salient distractor under threat of shock compared to baseline conditions, unlike in older
adults with no effect. This modulation of attentional priority was only observable immediately following shock delivery and dissipated over time. Additionally, we found moderate evidence supporting
the null hypothesis that arousal does not modulate the speed of attention processing in either age group.
These results suggest that arousal selectively modulates attentional priority maps in the early visual
cortex but does not influence broader interactions across higher order attentional networks. While first
fixation measures revealed age-related differences consistent with the hypothesis of LC-NA system
hyperactivity in aging, pupillometry and processing speed measures showed age-equivalent effects.
Together, these findings highlight the potential for age-related changes in the LC-NA system to
modulate mechanisms of attentional control and demonstrate the utility of eye movement measures as a
promising tool to track changes across the adult lifespan.
Public Significance Statement
As we age, the brain’s ability to filter relevant from distracting information changes. This study
examined eye movements under stressful conditions to determine whether age-related shifts in
attention reflect changes in the brain’s arousal system. Our findings demonstrate that aging alters
how arousal influences which stimuli capture attention without affecting pupil responses or processing speeds.

Aging is commonly associated with declines in cognitive control,
particularly the reduced ability to inhibit irrelevant or distracting
information. A foundational account of these changes is the inhibitory
deficit hypothesis (Hasher & Zacks, 1988), which posits that aging
impairs inhibitory mechanisms across a broad range of cognitive
tasks. While this framework has received extensive empirical
support, accumulating evidence suggests a more nuanced picture.
Recent meta-analyses indicate that age-related inhibitory deficits
vary across different task contexts (Rey-Mermet & Gade, 2018), and
in some cases, older adults may even show preserved or enhanced

attentional processes, pointing to possible compensatory mechanisms in older adults (Vallesi et al., 2021; Veríssimo et al., 2022).
Nonetheless, neuroimaging studies have revealed that even when
behavioral performance appears equivalent across young and older
adults, the underlying neural mechanisms controlling inhibitory
processing among older adults appear to be altered. For instance, in a
Stroop interference functional magnetic resonance imaging task,
older adults showed significantly greater frontal brain activation
despite comparable inhibitory performance (Langenecker et al.,
2004). Electroencephalography studies further reveal that while
older adults demonstrate similar neural responses to task-relevant
information, they exhibit prominent deficits in suppressing activity
related to task-irrelevant stimuli that is specifically linked to declines
in working memory performance (Gazzaley et al., 2005). Eventrelated potential studies also show reduced amplitudes and delayed
peak latencies in older adults during attentional inhibition tasks,
suggesting that aging does indeed lead to slower and less efficient
inhibitory processing (Kropotov et al., 2016). These findings have
led researchers to propose that increased brain activation in older
adults reflects compensatory recruitment of additional brain resources to maintain performance and counteract declining inhibitory efficiency (Cabeza, 2002; Davis et al., 2008; Zanto &
Gazzaley, 2017). Although such compensatory mechanisms in older
adults may yield performance levels similar to that of young adults,
the biological mechanisms underlying this adaptation remain
unclear.
One plausible contributor to age-related changes in inhibitory
control is the altered functioning of neuromodulatory systems that
support cognition (Krohn et al., 2023). The locus coeruleus (LC) is a
brainstem nucleus that is the primary source of noradrenaline in the
human brain, and the LC-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system regulates a
wide range of cognitive functions, including attentional control
(Berridge, 2008; Berridge & Waterhouse, 2003; Maness et al.,
2022). Compared to young adults, older adults show increased
distractibility by salient but irrelevant stimuli (Hasher & Zacks,
1988; Kubo-Kawai & Kawai, 2010; Lustig et al., 2007; West &
Alain, 2000; Zeef et al., 1996), a behavioral pattern that has been
linked to reduced functional connectivity and decreased activation
in the frontoparietal attention networks (Campbell et al., 2012;
Geerligs et al., 2015; Grady et al., 2016; Kennedy & Mather, 2019;
Madden, 2007; Nashiro et al., 2017). Previous studies have shown
that the LC-NA system mediates these neural networks of attentional control (Bouret & Sara, 2004; Unsworth & Robison, 2017)
and that disruptions in LC-NA system function may lead to broader
downstream changes in cognitive processing (Maness et al., 2022).
Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques have enabled researchers to quantify the structural integrity of the LC (Cassidy et al.,
2022; Clewett et al., 2016; Dahl et al., 2019, 2022, 2023; Hämmerer
et al., 2018). Notably, magnetic resonance imaging signal intensity
of the LC has been associated with LC-NA system function and has
been used as a biomarker for age-related dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases (Betts et al., 2019; K. Y. Liu et al., 2020). LC
signal intensity follows an inverted U-shaped trajectory across the
human lifespan with increases during early and middle adulthood,
peaking around age 60, and declining thereafter (K. Y. Liu et al.,
2019). This trajectory suggests that age-related changes in attentional control may be directly linked to the structural and functional
integrity of the LC. In aging, diminished LC magnetic resonance
imaging contrast has been linked to poorer cognitive performance
and increased risk for the progression of neurodegenerative diseases
(Elman et al., 2021; Hämmerer et al., 2018). Functional connectivity
studies further reveal altered LC functional connectivity in older
adults (Jacobs et al., 2015; T.-H. Lee et al., 2018, 2020; Takahashi et
al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). Collectively, these findings portray a
dysfunctional LC-NA system in the aging human brain that disrupts
critical cognitive processing mechanisms.
In this article, we investigate whether age-related changes in the
LC-NA system underlie observed alterations in attentional control
mechanisms. Specifically, we draw on the arousal-biased competition (ABC) theory, which conceptualizes the LC-NA system’s role
in mediating arousal to shape cognition. In this framework, the LCNA system modulates the neural representation of stimuli based on
their existing attentional priority, amplifying high-priority information (“winner-take-more”) and suppressing low-priority information (“loser-take-less”) under conditions of heightened arousal
(Mather & Sutherland, 2011). Thus, arousal dynamically sharpens
competition among stimuli, enhancing the processing of intrinsically salient cues under signals of threat. The Glutamate Amplifies
Noradrenergic Effect model poses that the biological basis of
increased priority is because of local noradrenergic “hot spots”
where norepinephrine and glutamate coactivation signals elevated
attentional priority (Mather et al., 2016a, 2016b). In contrast,
widespread noradrenaline release outside these hot spots suppresses
processing, addressing observations of arousal-induced inhibition
(Mather et al., 2016b). We leveraged this framework to examine
whether age-related changes in attentional control are linked to
alterations in the LC-NA system–mediated arousal responses.
Recent work has shown that older adults exhibit higher LC activation during encoding of salient and negative stimuli compared
with young adults (Ludwig et al., 2024), indicating that aging leads
to increased noradrenergic activity. Based on these findings, we
hypothesized that older adults exhibit sustained LC-NA system
hyperactivity compared with young adults and that increased
arousal will not enhance attentional prioritization of salient stimuli
as seen in young adults.
Prior studies have shown that arousal increases attention priority
for salient or valenced stimuli in young adults but not in older adults
when measuring motor response times (Allen et al., 2017; Svärd et
al., 2014), recognition memory accuracy (Durbin et al., 2018;
Gallant et al., 2020), and brain activation patterns (Gallant et al.,
2022; T.-H. Lee et al., 2018). However, the brain mechanisms for
this age-related difference remain unclear. Specifically, it is unknown
whether older adults’ failure to prioritize salient stimuli under
arousal reflects reduced modulation in early sensory regions or
broader disruption in higher order cognitive processes. T.-H. Lee et
al. (2018) found that arousal increased activation in the parahippocampal place area for both salient and nonsalient stimuli in
older adults, suggesting that loss of selectivity toward salient stimuli
was a result of generalized elevation in brain activity. Using a fear
conditioning paradigm, they showed that arousal in older adults
leads to widespread effects on cognitive processes regardless of
stimulus relevance. In contrast, Gallant et al. (2022) observed that
arousing scenes selectively increased brain activation in young
adults but not in older adults, demonstrating that attentional
selectivity under arousal was indeed based on stimulus priority.
Gallant et al.’s findings suggest that the effects of arousal may
specifically be targeting early sensory regions (e.g., visual cortex),
and the attentional priority maps may be specifically targeted under

elevated arousal (Itti & Koch, 2000, 2001). In this study, we employed two complementary methodological approaches to test our
hypothesis that the LC-NA system exhibits hyperactivity in aging
and to clarify how arousal modulates the attentional mechanisms
underlying biased competition. Although prior work by T.-H. Lee et
al. and Gallant et al. has identified similar age-related differences in
the influence of arousal on attentional control, their findings
diverged in terms of the specific mechanisms through which
arousal alters stimulus prioritization. These differences imply
distinct interpretations of how the LC-NA system mediates attentional networks.
To address this gap, we measured eye movements in a visual
search array that simultaneously presented multiple stimulus types
(e.g., goal-directed, salient, nonsalient), allowing us to observe how
arousal influences multiple types of mechanisms in both young and
older adults. We implemented an oculomotor visual search task that
required participants to make eye movements toward stimuli,
capturing both the speed and direction of multiple saccades on each
trial (Kim, Senior, et al., 2024). The initiation of eye movements in
visual attention and perception involves a neural network, including
the frontal eye fields, visual cortical region V4, superior colliculus,
and mediodorsal thalamus (Armstrong et al., 2006; Bruce &
Goldberg, 1985; Sommer & Wurtz, 2002, 2006). Importantly, all of
these brain regions receive efferent projections from the LC
(Kalwani et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018; Loughlin et al., 1986;
McBurney-Lin et al., 2019; Pickel et al., 1974; Schwarz et al., 2015),
and prior research has shown that the LC-NA system modulates
visual attention via these circuits (Grefkes et al., 2010; Kalwani et
al., 2014; M. Lee et al., 2020; Sawaguchi & Kikuchi, 1998). In
rhesus macaques, using an α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist suppressed eye movements to remembered locations in a memoryguided saccade task (Sawaguchi & Kikuchi, 1998). Additionally,
electrophysiological recordings from LC neurons showed activation
during planned, saccadic eye movements to a target (Kalwani et al.,
2014). However, it remains unclear how fluctuations in LC activity
relate to changes in the direction and speed of eye movements in
humans. Furthermore, eye movement metrics offer significantly
greater reliability than motor responses, especially in aging populations in which motor variability is high (Kim, Grégoire, &
Anderson, 2024). Notably, older adults show particularly high
reliability in oculomotor capture by salient stimuli, which will be the
primary measure of focus in this experiment. In addition to eye
movements, we recorded baseline pupil size and stimulus-evoked
pupil responses as indirect markers of LC activity. Prior research
supports a robust link between LC activity and pupil dynamics in
humans (DiNuzzo et al., 2019; Grueschow et al., 2021, 2022;
Murphy et al., 2014) and showed a causal link between LC firing
and pupil size in macaque monkeys (Joshi et al., 2016) and rodents
(Breton-Provencher & Sur, 2019; Y. Liu et al., 2017). Furthermore,
researchers have shown that evoked pupil dilations covary with
transient increases in LC activity (de Gee et al., 2017; Joshi et al.,
2016; Joshi & Gold, 2022; Murphy et al., 2014; Varazzani et al.,
2015). Both eye tracking and pupillometry measures will be utilized
to assess LC-NA system activity. Second, we manipulated state
arousal using the threat of unpredictable shock paradigm in which
an electric shock is administered at random times (Schmitz &
Grillon, 2012). Unlike brief or predictable arousal manipulations
in prior studies (Zsido´, 2024), this approach mimics elevated tonic
noradrenergic activity more representative of hypothesized aging
related hyperactivity. Prior studies using this paradigm in young
adults have shown increased attentional priority for salient stimuli,
reduced priority for reward-associated stimuli, and improved goaldirected attentional control (Kim & Anderson, 2020a, 2020b; Kim et
al., 2021), aligning with the model of ABC (Mather & Sutherland,
2011). However, this is the first application of this paradigm to
investigate age differences among young and older adults.
In this experiment, we measured the direction of the first saccade
following the onset of the visual search array along with three
indices of attention processing speed: total fixation time, saccadic
latency, and dwell time. The location of the first fixation reveals
whether attentional priority was allocated toward the goal-relevant
target or the salient, task-irrelevant distractor. If arousal influences
the first fixation location, this suggests that arousal biases attentional
priority at the level of early sensory priority maps in the visual
cortex, supporting the conclusions of Gallant et al. (2022). In
contrast, if arousal modulates the speed of attention processing,
these findings would suggest the modulation of higher order
attentional control networks (Corbetta et al., 2008; Corbetta &
Shulman, 2002), consistent with the conclusions of T.-H. Lee et al.
(2018). We also considered the possibility that arousal may modulate all measures, indicating a more comprehensive impact of
arousal and LC-NA hyperactivity on the attentional system across
multiple stages of brain processing.
Method
Transparency and Openness
The data and analytic code have been made publicly available on
the Open Science Framework at https://osf.io/hmfzq (Kim, Nguyen,
et al., 2024). The study design, hypotheses, and analytic plan were
not preregistered.
Participants and Sample Size Calculations
For this experiment, we used a portion of a data set published in
Kim, Senior, et al. (2024), which investigated age differences in
mechanisms of attentional control without the threat of unpredictable
shock. From this data set, we used the data from all participants who
completed both the arousal and nonarousal blocks of the experiment
using the identical oculomotor visual search task (14 young adults and
18 older adults—only the nonarousal data were previously published).
In the current experiment, our research goal was to investigate age
differences in the mechanisms of ABC and its relationship with the
LC-NA system. We conducted a power analysis to assess the adequate
sample size required to probe this research question.
Previous studies have never used the unpredictable threat of
shock paradigm in an oculomotor visual search task with older
adults. In Kim, Senior, et al. (2024), we identified that observing age
differences in eye movement measures to assess mechanisms of
biased competition resulted in a significant Age × First-Saccade
Destination interaction effect with an effect size of η2 p = .187. In
addition, older adults exhibit high reliability for attention capture by
the salient distractor in the same oculomotor visual search task, r =
0.890 [0.774, 0.948] (rS-B = 0.942 [0.877, 0.973]), that was even
superior to the reliability for that in young adults (p = .016; Kim,
Grégoire, & Anderson, 2024). Finally, T.-H. Lee et al. (2018)
identified that inducing arousal with an auditory tone conditioned

2 p
with electric shock in older adults revealed a significant main effect
of arousal on older adults on neural activity in the hippocampal place
area regardless of saliency type with an effect size of η2 p = .178.
Given these effect sizes, we conducted a power analysis (G*Power
3.1) and identified that to observe a within-between interaction in a
mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) at effect size f = 0.4, α = .05,
and power (1 − β) = 0.9, a sample size of at least 34 young and older
adults was required. Thus, we newly recruited 20 young adults and
16 older adults to add to our preexisting data set for a total of 34
young adults (female = 23, male = 10, prefer not to say = 1) aged
18–30 inclusive (M = 21.2, SD = 2.9) and 34 older adults (female =
26, male = 8) aged 55–80 inclusive (M = 69.0, SD = 7.2; see Table 1
for self-reported ethnicity). We recruited young adults from the
university Sona Systems subject pool for course credit and recruited
older adults from the local communities for monetary compensation.
We screened older adults for cognitive dysfunction using the
telephone screening protocol and excluded individuals who scored
below the cutoff threshold of 16 from the study (Gatz et al., 1995).
All study protocols were approved by the University of Southern
California Institutional Review Board (Noradrenergic Activity
and Attention, UP-21-00711). All participants provided written,
informed consent before participation. Data collection was completed during 2023–2024.
Apparatus
A custom-built Next-Level Gaming desktop computer (NextLevel Gaming, Los Angeles, California, United States) equipped
with MATLAB software (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts,
United States) and Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Brainard,
1997) was used to present the stimuli on a Sun Microsystems 4472
(Oracle Corporation, Santa Clara, California, United States) cathode
ray tube monitor (85 Hz refresh rate). The participants viewed the
monitor from 70 cm in a dark, soundproof room. We employed the
EyeLink 1000 Plus system (SR Research Ltd., Ottawa, Ontario,
Canada) for eye tracking and ensured head position stability with a
chin rest provided by the manufacturer (SR Research Ltd.).
Electric shock was administered on the third and fourth fingers using
a battery-powered transcutaneous aversive stimulator (Coulbourn
Instruments, Allentown, Pennsylvania, United States; Model Number
E13-22). Electrodes were attached to the participants’ fingers (BIOPAC
Systems, Goleta, California, United States; EL507A) with the application of an electrode gel (BIOPAC Systems, GEL101A).
Stimuli
In the oculomotor search paradigm, every trial comprised a gazecontingent fixation display, a visual search array, and an intertrial

interval (see Figure 1). The fixation display comprised a fixation
cross (0.7° × 0.7° visual angle) at the center of the screen. The
fixation display remained on screen until eye position was registered
within 1.3° of the center of the fixation cross for a continuous period
of 500 ms (Kim & Anderson, 2022; Kim, Senior, et al., 2024). The
visual search array was then presented for 2,000 ms or until a
fixation on the target was registered. If a target was not fixated within
the timeout limit, the words “Eye Error” would appear in the center
of the screen for 500 ms. Finally, the intertrial interval comprised a
blank screen for 1,000 ms. Participants were instructed to search for
the unique shape among four stimuli (one circle among three
diamonds or one diamond among three circles; see Figure 1). No
motor responses were required, and oculomotor fixation on the
target ended the trial immediately. The length and width of each of
the shapes were 4.2° (visual angle), except for the circle with a
diameter of 4.0° for all shapes to have approximately equal area.
Each shape was placed at equal intervals along an imaginary circle
with a radius of 9.1°. The color of the shapes was red or green. In
addition, the color of the distractor on distractor-present trials was
counterbalanced across all participants (red distractor among green
shapes or green distractor among red shapes).
Design and Procedure
Participants first calibrated the intensity of the electric shock to an
equal subjective intensity that is “unpleasant, but not painful,” as in
prior studies (Kim & Anderson, 2020a, 2020b). Subjects were only
connected to the shock device during this calibration process or
when completing the shock block to allow for the arousal-inducing
nature of the device to dissipate (Kim & Anderson, 2020b). The
calibration procedure began at the lowest intensity (“feels like a
tickle on your finger”) and increased step by step until the participant
told the experimenter that the intensity had become “unpleasant, but
not painful.” After calibration, participants completed 20 practice
trials of the task they were going to complete, ensuring they
understood the task instructions. Participants achieved a passing
score of 90% accuracy to move forward, and the practice task would
repeat until they reached this threshold. Participants then completed
two blocks of the task: a no shock block and a shock block. Each
block comprised four runs of 96 trials each, totaling 384 trials. We
counterbalanced whether participants completed the shock block
first or second.
We fully counterbalanced the location of the target in distractorabsent trials and the location of the target and the location of the
distractor in relation to the target in distractor-present trials. Trials
were randomized across all participants and were distractor absent
(no salient color distractor) or distractor present (one salient color
distractor) equally often. The target shape also was the circle or
diamond equally often, and the distractor color (red or green) was
counterbalanced across participants.
Data Analysis
Eye position was calibrated to each run using 5-point calibration
and was manually drift corrected online by the experimenter as
necessary during the gaze-contingent fixation display (Kim &
Anderson, 2022; Kim, Senior, et al., 2024). During the experiment,
the X and Y positions of the eyes were continuously monitored in
real time regarding the four stimulus positions, and fixations were

recorded during the experiment (fixations to every stimulus on each
trial were logged and exported at the end of each run, as in Kim,
Senior, et al., 2024; Kim & Anderson, 2020a, 2020b, 2022). The
EyeLink 1000 Plus also exported an Eyelink Data file after each run
that contained both sample information collected at 1,000 Hz and
manually encoded event time stamps: presentation of the fixation
stimulus, onset of the visual search array, fixation of each stimulus
during visual search, and the end of the trial. Fixation of a stimulus
was registered if eye position remained within a region extending
1.0° around the stimulus for a continuous period of at least 50 ms for
nontargets and distractors and at least 100 ms for the target (Kim &
Anderson, 2022). No fixation times were three standard deviations
below the mean for any of our participants and thus would not have
changed results even if we had used the same threshold for target
fixation. Saccades were defined as a minimum eye velocity
threshold of 30° per second and a minimum acceleration threshold
of 9,500° per second.
Fixation times were defined as the time measured from the onset
of the stimulus array until a valid fixation was registered for the
target shape. Fixation times that exceeded three standard deviations
of the mean for a condition for each participant were trimmed (Kim
& Anderson, 2022; Kim, Senior, et al., 2024). First fixations were
defined as the first stimulus that was initially registered as a fixation
on each trial. First fixations to the target, nontarget stimuli, and
distractor stimuli, in addition to accuracy and fixation times, were
derived from the eye data recorded online during the experiment (see

Framework). Percent of saccades to the nontarget stimuli was
corrected to provide a per-item estimate of fixation; on distractorabsent and distractor-present trials, the percentage of saccades was
divided by 3 and 2, respectively. Dwell times were defined as the
duration that the eyes remained within the fixation window of the
stimulus and were also recorded online. Saccadic reaction times
(sRTs) were computed as the time to initiate a saccade relative to
the onset of the visual search array (Kim & Anderson, 2022; Kim,
Senior, et al., 2024). Mean sRTs were computed offline from the
EyeLink 1000 Eyelink Data output files using the edfmex
MATLAB executable file and the “STARTSACC” code string
from the event structure.
Statistical analyses were completed using SPSS (IBM, Armonk,
New York, United States). Cohen’s d measures of effect sizes were
calculated using corrected standard deviations of the mean difference as output by SPSS. Mixed ANOVA analyses were conducted
with age as a between-subjects factor and all other measures as a
within-subjects measure. Post hoc t test analyses were completed
using paired-sample comparisons for within-subjects measures and
independent-sample comparisons for between-subjects measures.
We also report 95% confidence intervals for nonsignificant effects of
arousal to estimate its effect size for each measure. When identifying
null effects of arousal, we conducted a Bayesian paired-samples t
test using JASP (Version 0.18.3) to investigate the evidence in
support of the null hypothesis: H0 = arousal does not modulate
mechanisms of attentional control (Wagenmakers, Love, et al.,
2018; Wagenmakers, Marsman, et al., 2018). The Bayes factor
(BF10) measures the strength of evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis compared to the null hypothesis H0, and a BF10
value of 1–0.33 reflects anecdotal evidence, 0.33–0.1 moderate
evidence, and <0.1 strong evidence in favor of the null hypothesis.

Arousal Does Not Modulate Goal-Directed Attentional

First-saccade destinations, or the stimulus that was first fixated at
the onset of the visual search array, reveal whether a goal-directed or
reflexive saccade was initiated following interactions between
neural networks of attention (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002). Both
goal-directed and reflexive saccades are programmed simultaneously at the onset of a visual search array (Case & Ferrera, 2007;
Nummela & Krauzlis, 2011; Pierrot-Deseilligny et al., 1995; Schall,
1995; Theeuwes et al., 1998). An initial saccade toward the target
would reveal a goal-directed saccade was initiated, while a saccade
toward nontarget stimuli would show a reflexive saccade was initiated as a product of interactions between multiple networks of
attention and visual attention priority maps (Itti & Koch, 2000,
2001). Greater first saccades toward the salient distractor compared
to the average of nontarget stimuli would show oculomotor capture
by the salient distractor compared with a within-subjects baseline.
Previously, we identified that older adults made significantly less
first saccades to the target stimuli compared with young adults,
demonstrating age-related impairments in mechanisms of goaldirected attentional control (Kim, Senior, et al., 2024). Here, we
investigated whether increased arousal modulates goal-directed
attentional control in both age groups. First, in distractor-absent

trials, we conducted a 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA analysis over factors age
(young vs. older), first-saccade destination (target vs. nontargets),
and arousal (no shock vs. shock). Distractor-absent trials allow for a
more accurate assessment of mechanisms of goal-directed attentional control without interactions of bottom-up attentional control
from the visual cortex induced by a physically salient stimulus (Itti
& Koch, 2001). We found a significant main effect of age, F(1, 66) =
11.34, p < .001, η2 p = .147, and first-saccade destination, F(1, 66) =
1760.18, p < .001, η2 p = .964, and a significant Age × First-Saccade
Destination interaction effect, F(1, 66) = 11.34, p < .001, η2 p = .147,
replicating prior findings of impaired mechanisms of goal-directed
attentional control in older adults (see Figure 2A and Supplemental
Table 1). However, we did not observe a main effect of arousal, F(1,
66) = 0.20, p = .660, nor any other interaction effects, Fs(1, 66) <
0.20, ps > .660. The mean difference for the effects of arousal on
first-saccade destinations to the target was 0.0% in young adults
(95% CI [−1.76, 1.76]), t(33), p = 1.000, and 0.76% in older adults
(95% CI [−2.27, 3.80]), t(33), p = .613. Bayesian analyses revealed
moderate evidence that arousal does not modulate goal-directed
attentional control in young, BF10 = 0.184 (error% = 0.041), and
older adults, BF10 = 0.207 (error% = 0.040).
Arousal Increases Oculomotor Capture by Salient
Stimuli in Young Adults but Not in Older Adults
In distractor-present trials, we can determine whether the attentional priority of salient stimuli overrides goal-directed attentional
priority if the first-saccade destination is a reflexive saccade toward
the distractor. If more reflexive first saccades go to the distractor
compared to a nontarget showing an oculomotor capture effect, we
can quantify the magnitude of attentional priority allocation toward
the salient color stimuli. First, we conducted a 2 × 3 × 2 ANOVA
analysis over factors age (young vs. older), first-saccade destination
(target vs. nontargets vs. distractor), and arousal (no shock vs.
shock) on distractor-present trials. We observed a significant main
effect of age, F(1, 66) = 9.81, p = .003, η2 p = .129, and first-saccade
destination, F(2, 132) = 245.37, p < .001, η2 p = .788, and a significant Age × First-Saccade Destination interaction effect, F(2,
132) = 9.27, p < .001, η2 p = .123 (see Figure 2B). We observed no
main effect of arousal, F(1, 66) = 0.13, p = .725, and no three-way
interaction between factors age, arousal, and first-saccade destination, F(2, 132) = 2.62, p = .076. The mean difference for the
effects of arousal on first-saccade destinations to the salient distractor was 2.82% in young adults (95% CI [0.59, 5.04]), t(33) =
2.58, p = .015, and 0.03% in older adults (95% CI [−2.38, 2.43]),
t(33) = 0.02, p = .981. Using Bayesian analyses, we identified
moderate evidence that arousal does not modulate attention capture by
the salient distractor in older adults, BF10 = 0.184 (error% = 0.041).
Next, we calculated the oculomotor capture effect by subtracting
the percentage of first fixations on a nontarget from the percentage of
first fixations on the salient distractor to appropriately measure
attention capture relative to a within-subject baseline (Wöstmann et
al., 2022). Thus, a positive oculomotor capture effect would indicate
increased attentional priority to specifically salient stimuli rather
than a general increase in reflexive and random saccades. Furthermore,
given that we did not identify a three-way interaction between
factors age, arousal, and first-saccade destination across all trials, we
investigated whether the ABC effect dissipates from receipt of an
electric shock. In the nonarousal blocks for each participant, we

Given that the effect of arousal exponentially dissipates in young
adults following receipt of an electric shock, we explored the effects of
induced arousal in the following measures, both averaged over all
trials and on the first trial after receipt of the electric shock in which the
ABC effect is maximal.
Arousal Does Not Modulate Accuracy and Fixation Time
Next, we explored whether arousal affected task performance
differently in young and older adults, beginning with mean accuracy, or whether participants fixated on the target within the time
limit. We first conducted a 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA analysis over factors
age (young vs. older), distractor presence (absent vs. present), and
arousal (no shock vs. shock) over all trials. We found a significant
main effect of age, F(1, 66) = 5.88, p = .018, η2 p = .082, and

effects, Fs(1, 66) < 1.63, ps > .265 (see Figure 4A).
Next, we investigated whether increased arousal differentially
modulates the speed of attention processing. When conducting the
aforementioned mixed ANOVA analysis with fixation time as the
dependent variable, we found a significant main effect of age, F(1,
66) = 31.68, p < .001, η2 p = .324, and distractor presence, F(1, 66) =

interaction effects, Fs(1, 66) < 1.05, ps > .309. In addition, arousal

trial after shock delivery for both young adults, distractor-absent

[−12.7, 52.6], t(33) = 1.24, p = .224, and older adults, distractorabsent trial: 18 ms mean difference, 95% CI [−45.4, 9.7], t(33) =

CI [−48.2, 21.8], t(33) = 0.77, p = .448. The significant Age ×
Distractor Presence interaction effect shows that the distractor
presence cost was greater in older adults; that is, older adults were
more negatively affected by the distractor with slower fixation times
compared with young adults. This age-related distractor presence
cost was persistent even when normalizing fixation time speeds
across age groups (see Kim, Senior, et al., 2024). A Bayesian pairedsamples t test revealed moderate evidence that arousal does not
modulate fixation times in both distractor-absent and distractorpresent trials respectively for young, BF10 = 0.295 and 0.310 (error
% = 0.037 and 0.036), and older adults, BF10 = 0.199 and 0.187
(error% = 0.040 and 0.041).
Arousal Does Not Modulate the Speed of Attention
Reorienting in Either Young or Older Adults
Next, we investigated how long participants fixated on an
incorrect initial saccade (when the first-saccade destination is not the
target), or dwell time, to probe attention mechanisms of reactive
disengagement and reorienting. Longer dwell times would show a
prolonged processing requirement of a stimulus until the next
saccade is initiated and show deficiencies in rejecting a stimulus as a
nontarget stimulus. A 2 × 2 × 2 ANOVA analysis over factors age
(young vs. older), stimuli (nontargets vs. distractor), and arousal (no
shock vs. shock) revealed a significant main effect of age, F(1,

Table 3). Furthermore, the significant interaction effect shows that
older adults had particularly longer dwell times compared with
young adults when the stimulus was the distractor, demonstrating an
age-related impairment in disengaging from salient stimuli compared with nonsalient stimuli. However, we again did not find a
main effect of arousal, F(1, 66) = 0.89, p = .350, nor any other
interaction effects, Fs(1, 66) < 0.51, ps > .477. A Bayesian pairedsamples t test revealed moderate evidence that arousal does not

respectively in young, BF10 = 0.234 and 0.185 (error% = 0.039 and

Next, we investigated whether elevated arousal produced age
differences in mean sRT (also known as saccadic latencies) or the
time to initiate the first saccade following the onset of the visual
search array. Mean sRTs measure the time required to resolve biased
competition between top–down and bottom-up networks of attention following the programming of both types of saccades. First, we

longer when the direction of the first saccade is toward the target
because of processing of goal-directed mechanisms of attention
compared with an automatic reflexive saccade driven by the visual
cortex. Furthermore, we identified that older adults exhibit longer
mean sRTs compared with young adults, showing a longer time
requirement to process visual stimuli (see Supplemental Table 3).
For distractor-present trials, we conducted a 2 × 3 × 2 ANOVA
analysis over factors age (young vs. older), stimuli (target vs.
nontargets vs. distractor), and arousal (no shock vs. shock) and
found no significant main effect of age, F(1, 66) = 2.84, p = .097,
but found a significant main effect of stimuli, F(2, 132) = 48.15, p <
.001, η2 p = .422, and a significant Age × Stimuli interaction effect,
F(2, 132) = 7.84, p < .001, η2 p = .106 (see Figure 5C and
Supplemental Table 3). As in distractor-absent trials, mean sRTs
were longer when making goal-directed saccades (toward the target)
compared to when making reflexive saccades, and older adults had
slower mean sRTs compared with young adults (see Supplemental
Table 3). However, older adults had significantly longer mean sRTs
compared with young adults when the direction of the saccade
was toward the distractor, as indicated by the interaction effect.

to anecdotal evidence for older adults, BF10 = [0.190, 0.342] (error

Arousal Increased Baseline Pupil Sizes and Decreased
Evoked Pupil Responses
Finally, we investigated whether the unpredictable threat of shock
modulated both baseline pupil sizes and evoked pupil responses
(pupil dilation) as indirect measures of the LC-NA system. Given
that participants were constantly under the threat of unpredictable
shock throughout the entire run, emulating conditions of increased
tonic noradrenergic activity, we hypothesized that the threat of
unpredictable shock would increase baseline pupil sizes and would
thus decrease phasic noradrenergic responses following the Yerkes–
Dodson arousal relationship (Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005). We
measured baseline resting pupil sizes within the 200 ms period
before the onset of the visual search array, during which only the
fixation cross was present on the screen. We defined pupil dilation
responses as the peak change in pupil size from baseline resting
states (% change).
We conducted a 2 × 2 mixed ANOVA analysis over factors age
(young vs. older) and arousal (no shock vs. shock) with baseline
pupil size on the first trial after shock delivery as the dependent
measure. We found a main effect of age, F(1, 66) = 27.68, p < .001,
η2 p = .295, and arousal, F(1, 66) = 25.99, p < .001, η2 p = .283, but no

significantly increased baseline pupil size in young adults by 0.21 mm
(95% CI [0.10, 0.32]), t(33) = 4.02, p < .001, d = 0.291, and older
adults by 0.15 mm (95% CI [0.05, 0.25]), t(33) = 3.16, p = .003, d =

Discussion
We hypothesized that age-related changes in mechanisms of
attentional control are driven by changes in the neuromodulatory
LC-NA system. Specifically, we predicted that elevated arousal
would enhance attentional priority for salient stimuli in young
adults, but not in older adults, due to the hypothesized elevated
levels of baseline noradrenergic activity associated with aging.
Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that arousal increased first
fixations to the salient, task-irrelevant distractor in young adults but
not in older adults. However, contrary to our predictions, arousal
did not modulate the speed of attention processing in either age
group. Bayesian analyses provided moderate support for the null
hypothesis, suggesting that arousal does not influence oculomotor
measures of attention processing speed in either young or older
adults. Pupillometry data further revealed age-equivalent effects of
arousal on evoked pupil responses, with higher levels of baseline
arousal leading to lower task-evoked dilation responses. From our
data, it seems possible that LC-NA system hyperactivity in aging is
minimal and not significantly different in cognitively healthy older
adults when compared with young adults. Alternatively, the absence
of arousal effects on attentional priority in older adults may reflect
age-related declines in functional connectivity between the LC and
the salience network (T.-H. Lee, Kim, et al., 2020). Prior studies
examining steady-state visual evoked potential have found equivalent distractor suppression in the visual cortex when comparing
young and older adults (Quigley et al., 2010; Quigley & Müller,
2014). These findings suggest that early sensory processing in the
visual cortex with respect to distractor suppression and inhibition of
attentional priority of irrelevant stimuli remains preserved in aging.
However, the present findings of arousal-induced changes in first
fixations but not attention processing speeds suggest that age-related
changes in the mechanisms of ABC are in early visual priority maps
in the visual cortex (Itti & Koch, 2000, 2001) and do not reflect
downstream interactions between higher order networks involving
attentional control and the LC-NA system. Our pupillometry results
provide support for the hypothesis that age-related shifts in attentional control may be mediated by alterations in neuromodulatory
function. Furthermore, recent work in nonhuman primates has
identified that optogenetic stimulation of LC neurons selectively
enhances stimulus detection by improving perceptual sensitivity
within the neuron’s receptive field (Ghosh & Maunsell, 2024),
suggesting a specific role of the LC-NA system in modulating early
attentional processes that is independent from general arousal. Our
finding that the effect of ABC dissipates in young adults following
the initial trial also suggests that modulations in attentional priority
were not a product of sustained arousal effects from the underlying
threat of unpredictable shock but rather from specific neuromodulatory mechanisms following shock delivery. Further research in
humans should aim to clarify the role of the LC-NA system and its
network-level interactions in shaping attentional control across the
adult lifespan.
Our use of an oculomotor visual search paradigm enabled us to
examine multiple mechanisms of attentional control and the effect of
arousal on each brain process. We specifically chose to use eye
movement measures for their high reliability in both young and
older adults (Kim, Grégoire, & Anderson, 2024), the relative
insensitivity to age-related motor confounds as compared with
motor response times (Hollingworth & Bahle, 2020), and the known
networks of interaction between the LC-NA system and the oculomotor system in visual perception (Grefkes et al., 2010; Joshi,
2023; Kalwani et al., 2014; M. Lee et al., 2020; Sawaguchi &
Kikuchi, 1998). We also employed the unpredictable threat of shock
to emulate sustained tonic noradrenergic hyperactivity hypothesized
to occur in aging. Our findings replicate previous observations of
age differences in the ABC literature with increased oculomotor
capture by salient stimuli under arousal in young adults, but not in
older adults (Allen et al., 2017; Durbin et al., 2018; Gallant et al.,
2020, 2022; T.-H. Lee et al., 2018; Svärd et al., 2014). Notably, our
use of oculomotor measures also provides clarity to a key theoretical
tension in the literature. T.-H. Lee et al. (2018) identified that older
adults’ reduced selectivity for salient stimuli under arousal was due
to a generalized increase in brain activity for all stimuli. In contrast,
Gallant et al. (2022) reported that arousal selectively increased
activation for salient stimuli in young adults, but not in older adults.
Our results support the interpretation that arousal selectively increases attentional priority to task-irrelevant salient distractors rather
than broadly enhancing attentional priority to all nontarget stimuli.
This pattern supports the view that arousal modulates visual priority
maps in the visual cortex specifically for salient stimuli, rather than
inducing a global shift from top–down goal-directed processing to
bottom-up, reflexive processing. These findings are consistent
with the ABC theory of perception and memory, which posits that
arousal amplifies the representation of high-priority stimuli while
suppressing lower priority information selectively (Mather &
Sutherland, 2011).
Additionally, we did not find evidence that arousal modulates
attention processing speeds, including the initiation of eye movements, reorienting, or target identification. This absence of an
arousal effect on processing speed was unexpected. In the visual
attention literature, elevated arousal has often been associated with
faster responses in spatial cuing tasks on valid trials and slower
responses on invalid trials (T.-H. Lee et al., 2014; Sawada & Sato,
2015; Sutton & Lutz, 2019). Other studies have shown that taskirrelevant arousing stimuli presented before a task can enhance
target identification speed (T.-H. Lee et al., 2012; Sutherland &
Mather, 2018; Zsido et al., 2020). In addition, arousing images have
been shown to increase dwell time, with these changes closely
linked to variations in pupil dilation (Astudillo et al., 2018). Our use
of the unpredictable threat of shock paradigm produced robust
increases in arousal as evidenced by significant changes in both
baseline pupil size and evoked pupil responses. However, when
measuring eye movements, we found no effect of arousal on processing speed, further supporting that ABC operates by modulating
attentional priority maps in the early visual cortex (Itti & Koch,
2000), rather than by influencing cognitive resources or processing

speed. Furthermore, two previous studies have also shown that
viewing arousing images induced changes in measures of pupillometry but did not improve recall of higher contrast stimuli (Ásgeirsson
& Nieuwenhuis, 2017, 2019). These studies also found no effect of
arousal on the timing of the late positive potential component, supporting that arousal primarily influences early sensory processing.
Together, these findings argue that the effects of arousal on attentional
control are likely mediated by selective changes in early visual representations, rather than downstream interactions between broader
attentional networks.
Interestingly, in our experimental manipulation, we observed the
effect of ABC exponentially dissipated in young adults, with the
strongest effect occurring immediately following shock delivery.
We used the threat of unpredictable shock to emulate states of tonic
noradrenergic hyperactivity that are hypothesized to occur in older
adults (Elman et al., 2017; Gannon & Wang, 2019; Mather, 2020;
Weinshenker, 2018), given that the threat of unpredictable shock has
been shown to reduce alpha oscillations in the parietal lobe that
mimic age-related changes (Balderston et al., 2017). Since our initial
analyses averaged across all trials without accounting for the timing
of the shock, we conducted a post hoc examination of whether the
arousal effect declined over time. We argue that the unpredictable
threat of shock was successful in elevating tonic noradrenergic
activity given that baseline pupil sizes were significantly elevated
when averaged across the entire block and not just the first trial after
shock delivery. These findings also align with the Glutamate
Amplifies Noradrenergic Effect model, which posits that arousal
produces local noradrenaline hot spots in regions representing
prioritized stimuli, thereby enhancing their priority (Mather et al.,
2016b). Our data suggest that while tonic arousal may persist, these
local noradrenergic hot spots form rapidly in response to phasic
arousal and decay exponentially, returning to baseline approximately 15 s after shock delivery. However, it remains unclear
whether the absence of such hot spots contributes to the attenuated
ABC effect observed in older adults. It is also plausible that arousal
effects on attentional priority require a threshold level of noradrenergic activation that is only reached immediately following shock
delivery and diminishes shortly thereafter. Future studies employing
direct electrophysiological recordings of noradrenergic neurons will
be necessary to confirm these hypotheses and clarify the dynamics
of tonic and phasic LC-NA activity in ABC.
Finally, we believe this study demonstrates the utility of eye
movement measures for investigating mechanisms of attentional
control and in neurodegenerative disease research. Eye movements,
in addition to pupillometry, are emerging as valuable noninvasive
indicators of LC function in humans (Joshi, 2023). Given the high
reliability of measures of oculomotor function even in older adults
(Kim, Grégoire, & Anderson, 2024), further establishing and validating eye movements as functional markers of LC-NA system
activity may be critical for tracking longitudinal changes in aging
and neurodegeneration. Prior research has shown that eye movement metrics, specifically saccadic latency, can distinguish between
neurodegenerative diseases (Garbutt et al., 2008; Lage et al., 2021;
Z. Liu et al., 2021) and differentiate between individuals with
Alzheimer’s disease from those in prodromal stages such as mild
cognitive impairment (Chehrehnegar et al., 2019, 2022; Opwonya et
al., 2022; Peltsch et al., 2014; Wilcockson et al., 2019). Our findings
lay the groundwork for future studies to further explore the broad
potential of eye movement measures as functional biomarkers that
may capture disease progression and aid in predicting transitions to
prodromal stages of dementia.
